{"review_sentence":{"0":"Had an amazing time here with my little girl and her gran on a sunny day in June.","1":"Variety of animals the zoo has is incredible, plenty of places to eat and drink, great selection of play parks for kids, and the staff do an amazing job of keeping the entire zoo immaculate.","2":"We all had a magical day and would highly recommend it for a day out with the family.","3":"It's a little bit hilly (especially on way up to see lions and tigers) but well worth the climb uphill to see such beautiful animals.","4":"The animal talks were highly engaging and would also highly recommend attending these when visiting.","5":"Keep up the brilliant work RZSS.","6":"We visited using the season ticket from our local zoo.","7":"From arrival we were made very welcome.","8":"Staff took time out to talk to us and tell us about the animals.","9":"We loved the large enclosures that the animals had to roam in and had great views of many during the day.","10":"Thank you everyone for a great day!","11":"We\u2019re members and love the zoo.","12":"So many different animals too see and easy to get to by the 26 or 31 bus from the Center.","13":"It is a challenging zoo as it\u2019s all on hill so be prepared to get your hike on but it\u2019s all worth it.","14":"Staff are great and always happy to helpWorth a visit we almost go every other month","15":"Brilliant day out with the Youth Club at the Zoo, we travelled all the way up from County Durham and the zoo staff couldnt have been more helpful from initial contact to collecting the tickets on the day.","16":"The zoo was clean and tidy and the group loved it with the penguins being a firm favourite.","17":"We even took advantage of the lunch voucher system and the visit triggered some additional workshops following the visit.","18":"This was without a doubt one of the best zoo visits we've ever had (helped by the fact we stayed at the Holiday Inn on sight and were offered discounted tickets after 14:00, so therefore the crowds had also dispersed)","19":"Despite the layout being steep, the views over Edinburgh were superb once at the top, everything was well laid out and easy to find.","20":"Just wish we'd had longer, but I'm sure we will return!","21":"Loved seeing all the different animals especially the penguins and giraffes!","22":"Great choice of gifts in gift shop.","23":"Staff all friendly, approachable and helpful.","24":"Despite the rain it was an enjoyable experience!","25":"We were welcomed by informative staff who were very friendly.","26":"The zoo is quite hilly , but the views are amazing.","27":"The animals are well looked after too.","28":"We were lucky enough to get a good look at the sloth who put on a little show!","29":"The penguins were great too.","30":"There\u2019s lots of cafes and areas to sit down.","31":"The shop is well stocked and reasonably priced.","32":"Had a really good day out at the zoo.","33":"We had two young children there and was good for all.","34":"The giraffes were so amazing they were inside","35":"and you coukd see them so close was an experience I won't be forgetting.","36":"All the facilities were clean the toilets at the top of the hill were as clean as the ones at the bottom of the hill.","37":"We used the accessibility van to get to top of the hill was amazing so we'll managed and the driver was so pleasant.","38":"Really like there sensory bags that they provide for disabled kids was very well done and such a good idea.","39":"All the staff were fab and so engaging with the little kids.","40":"Brilliant zoo loved how close you got to the animals would definitely come back.","41":"Great day out would recommend to anyone.","42":"Place was clean and the exhibits were great, shame a few were closed at the time, staff were friendly but didn\u2019t enjoy the food","43":"The experience was wonderful, the Zoo is massive and there is so much to see!","44":"The Enclosures and the animals look well cared for and there is lots of information to learn about each animal and the natural habitats, the zoo overall is clean and even outside of the enclosures it\u2019s pretty.","45":"I\u2019ve been many times and it doesn\u2019t get boring, one thing I would say it is pricey.","46":"Lovely big zoo, numerous animals .","47":"Very steep hill to get to top but restaurants and food\/drink places on way up.","48":"Big gift shop , staff very pleasant .","49":"Will definitely be visiting again.","50":"We pre-booked the tickets online.","51":"The queue to get in was massive - queued all the way up the hill!","52":"It did move fairly quickly though and in about 10 minutes we were at the desk.","53":"I initially thought the entrance fee was a bit high (\u00a325), but given how long you can spend here, I now feel it\u2019s good value.","54":"We were there over 4 hours, but could have stayed longer.","55":"There are so many different animals to see.","56":"You can pick up a helpful map at the entrance desk that shows you where each animal is located.","57":"The zoo is on a hill, so some of the uphill walks are a little steep.","58":"Most animals seemed to have decent sized enclosures (for a zoo).","59":"We had a great time at the zoo.","60":"The weather was great so we were able to spend a lot of time there.","61":"The problem was parking.","62":"When we arrived there was a sign saying the car park was full, we drove off to look for something else, unfortunately there was nothing.","63":"So we went back and checked to see if there were any spaces but unfortunately we were asked to leave because apparently there were no spaces as the car park attendant said, when we asked why we couldn't park we were told that when there were 20 spaces they would open the car park.","64":"Ridiculous!!!","65":"The car park staff were very rude and aggressive.","66":"I expected to have somewhere to park, especially since I had spent \u00a3150 on tickets.","67":"Due to the lack of spaces I will not be returning to this place","68":"Animals and weather were great.","69":"Saw a lot, which is lucky as the animals have the freedom to roam between their own private out the way areas, and their public view areas.","70":"Pricing though is now bordering on unaffordable.","71":"Food - we ate at the Gannet.","72":"Chicken wings were overcooked and dry.","73":"Onion rings were just batter with one sliver of onion.","74":"Very disappointing and expensive for what it was.","75":"If you go, bring your own drinks.","76":"A 330ml can of Fanta?","77":"\u00a32.60.A small juice carton - the little lunchbox ones for kids?","78":"\u00a31.95.I expect a markup, but 150+% is laughable.","79":"The giftshop is where it gets full on ridiculous though.","80":"Small stuffed toys ranging from \u00a330.","81":"We saw priced at \u00a368 a 22cm Meerkat.","82":"Had the items been in any way reasonably priced, we'd likely have made a purchase or two.","83":"Can get similar items on Amazon for \u00a37.The other trinkets and souvenirs are equally as ridiculously priced.","84":"I see the zoo reply with explanations of \"oh but the money goes to the animals.","85":"\"But that doesn't make the price gouging any less off-putting.","86":"We won't be back.","87":"My partner booked us a Zoo Keeper experience day for my birthday.","88":"I'm not sure what I expected but this exceeded everything I had hoped for!!","89":"Charlie and Megan guided us around most of the zoo and we got hands on experience preparing and feeding around 7 different species (including Rhino, Lion, Chimps, Sloths!).","90":"They were so thorough and gave us some detailed knowledge on each animal.","91":"The whole day was just incredible and we have both been on a high since.","92":"Charlie and Megan are both an absolute credit to their profession.","93":"Their passion and respect for the animals, and for conservation & education was evident throughout the day.","94":"Thanks again to you both for making it such an unforgettable and special day.","95":"Best birthday gift ever!","96":"We had a lovely visit to Edinburgh Zoo.","97":"The staff were incredibly helpful - since we were visiting with young baby, they offered us a ride in a zoo vehicle to start at the top of the hill.","98":"This made it much easier to walk down through the zoo with the buggy, and we really appreciated the thoughtful support.","99":"It was a fairly quiet day, but we still got to see some great animals, including lions, giraffes, chimpanzees, and a few others.","100":"Some animals were less active, but that's to be expected on the time of day.","101":"At the end of the visit, there is a great shopping area near the exit with a wide range of souvenirs and gifts - perfect for picking up something to remember the day.","102":"The zoo is clean, well laid out, and very family friendly.","103":"we were having a great time and were at the penguins until a manager told us that we had to leave because SOMEONE else and their daughter was being rude to us and gave us the middle finger for absolutely no reason, including with dirty looks and the workers there STILL told us to leave because apparently only their side of the story matters and couldn't even spare 2 seconds to hear what they done to us, although we done nothing.","104":"The workers Emily and Ve  told us to leave while being aggressive and not letting any of us speak.","105":"Just because they were full Scottish and we were from somewhere else we had to leave immediately even though they were being extremely rude.","106":"Must be why they wouldnt even let us speak nor  listen to us at all.","107":"I DO NOT recommend coming to Edinburgh zoo, racism is too normalised and the workers there clearly normalised it aswell.","108":"Speaking about the actual zoo, the animals are nice and it was a fun experience.","109":"But speaking about the workers and the people there not so much.","110":"If you're foreign like us it might not be for you as the workers treat you differently.","111":"We had such a fantastic day from start to end!","112":"So many animals to explore, a fantastic set up with wonderful enclosures and information.","113":"Great viewing points for children too.","114":"By far the best part of our experience was the staff members.","115":"So many volunteers helped us see animals which were tucked away or told us things we didn\u2019t know.","116":"Even when purchasing a few toys at the end the shop assistant asked about our day, favourite animal and then told us something we didn\u2019t know again!","117":"Can\u2019t wait to go back!","118":"We had a lovely day at the zoo.","119":"We arrived just after 10 on Sunday it was reasonably busy on entry we didn't wait long  though and when inside people soon spread out so it didn't feel too busy at all.","120":"It was a nice enough day and we enjoyed our walk around.","121":"We headed up hill to the right first taking it all in along the way.","122":"You don't walk far between animals so the hill doesn't seem so daunting,  steep in bits though.","123":"We had an ice cream\/ coffee stop first and a play at play park.","124":"Then continued up to the top of the hill where we got chips and juice for lunch.","125":"Ice cream again on way back down.","126":"Our 4 year old managed until around 3.30pm before needing a stroller","127":"but I just popped down and hired one then (\u00a37.50 + \u00a310deposit) - it was a life saver for the last couple of hours.","128":"Our favourite animals were sloth, porcupine,  lion,  rhino, penguin, giraffe,  zebra,  monkeys... really all of them!","129":"And the play parks are fun.","130":"Staff are lovely.","131":"A fab day out.","132":"My wife has just been to the zoo to redeem her Christmas gift,, taking in a half day zookeeper experience.","133":"Natalie, our experienced zookeeper, met us at just before 9am and took us both (I had already paid for my entrance to the zoo) to the starting point in the zookeeper hut.","134":"There, she explained all the Health & Safety and we set off to the buff cheeked Gibbons enclosure.","135":"Gibbons cleaned out and breakfast fed, we set off to see Otto in the pygmy hippo enclosure.","136":"Gillian got to feed him with a pair of tongs for safety.","137":"He was so cute and likes a carrot or 10!","138":"He even managed a poo whilst we were there \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02.","139":"Natalie had warned us this would happen.","140":"Next stop we went to see the armadillos and sloths.","141":"Gillian got a feed and a hold of a 3 ringed armadillo.","142":"So cute, but huge claws on them.","143":"Cheeky wee feed of the sloth and we were off again, to see the penguins and feed them.","144":"Gillian got to go into the penguin enclosure and feed them some fish, which she absolutely loved.","145":"Throughout the experience, Natalie fed us lots of information and she was an excellent guide.","146":"Couldn't speak any higher of her.","147":"Such a lovely girl","148":"and she knew her stuff!","149":"I'd strongly recommend this experience to anyone with a love of animals","150":"Apart from being on the side of a mountain (or it felt like it)","151":"it's one of the nicest.zoos.ive been to ,it was clean a.d well presented","152":"My girlfriend wanted to visit it for a long time ago.","153":"Well in April we could make it.","154":"That was the best zoo experience in our life.","155":"The animals look happy and healthy.","156":"So, I\u2019ve been here two times before and said I wouldn\u2019t go again.","157":"The ticket prices are high but got a deal so worked out as \u00a37 per person (universal credit offer).This is the first time I\u2019ve enjoyed it.","158":"Would I pay full price though, no I wouldn\u2019t.","159":"But I would pay the discounted price again.","160":"Make sure to download the app!If you visit, to go to the talks even if you don't know the animal because they're fascinating to learn about.","161":"We learnt about Warty-Pigs and Drill (a type of big Monkey)","162":"they're really interesting animals and we got to see the Drill really close.","163":"One of the best Zoos I have been to, with lots of cafes with good food for when you're tired.","164":"Overall this is a really nice zoo.","165":"We were able to see almost all of the animals at some point although some enclosures we had to revisit.","166":"Some enclosures and paddocks felt a bit small but most were generous.","167":"The animals looked happy, relaxed and well looked after.","168":"They were a pleasure to stand and watch.","169":"I knew Edinburgh had hills but this zoo is not mobility friendly with some excessive steep hills.","170":"Steps could be put in half was across these paths but I appreciate this would have an effect on vehicles.","171":"Some vans drove with care and patience however there was a lady in a white van who looked very young who was driving quickly and I almost fell moving out of the way.","172":"We went to eat at Grasslands.","173":"The service was great.","174":"A lady called Hannah saw I was struggling with the online order service and asked her supervisor to assist.","175":"This was sorted fast with no fuss or embarrassment.","176":"I loved Hannah's \"positive vibes\" she's a delight and credit to the team and clearly well suited to the role.","177":"Additionally at the sloths house a lady called Emma was able to give lots of information on the sloths and armadillo","178":"and we were totally entertained and educated.","179":"It's obvious the staff here are good at their jobs and the animals respond to this.","180":"We pre booked the week before, sadly on the day the weather wasn\u2019t great , windy and rain , but we went ahead and actually enjoyed the visit , lots of animals to see and the restaurants where reasonably priced , and lots of toilets at various points , highly recommend visiting.","181":"We took our young child to the zoo in the hopes that we could educate him about wildlife and animal conservation.","182":"He was particularly pleased to see the penguins and capybaras","183":"so no complaints there.","184":"However, there is an issue that has caused us great upset.","185":"Went to see the wallabys, they were lounging around and wouldnt stand up to hop so not much to see so right beside them, there are goats so we took the child over to see them.","186":"We were met with the sight of the dominant male goat, repeatedly trying to force himself onto the female goat and mate with her against her will.","187":"The female goat kept trying to get away but he was persistent and repeatedly overpowered her.","188":"Other families were upset seeing this, several of us yelled at the male goat to stop but he would not.","189":"We saw staff nearby and doing absolutely nothing to intervene in what was clearly a non consensual assault.","190":"My child and other children were getting upset, my child said to me as I led him away 'why is that goat hurting the other one?'I did not plan to have to explain to my child about such a subject after a zoo visit.","191":"Disappointed the staff did not stop it.","192":"We had a fantastic day at Edinburgh Zoo!","193":"It's such a well-laid-out and engaging place, and we were genuinely impressed by the variety of animals\u2014especially the pallas cats, which we\u2019d never seen before.","194":"Huge highlight!","195":"The penguins were also a joy to watch\u2014many of them were nesting and had eggs, which was such a special thing to see up close.","196":"Having visited zoos, safaris, and wildlife parks both across the UK and abroad, we\u2019ve seen our fair share, but this place truly stands out.","197":"Considering my husband works in animal welfare and knows his stuff, the fact that he loved it too says a lot.","198":"The enclosures looked thoughtfully designed, and the animals all seemed well cared for.","199":"A brilliant experience for both animal enthusiasts and curious visitors alike!One thing to consider however, this zoo is on a very big hill - possible mobility issues.","200":"Start from the top and work your way down.","201":"Lovely day out, saw pretty much all the animals, staff were friendly!","202":"\ud83d\ude42 Spoke to volunteer and were really helpfull!","203":"5*","204":"We study at an animal based college and we came along for a trip to help with assignments.","205":"I absolutely loved every moment of it, there is a large range of species and the staff across the zoo are lovely.","206":"Would definitely love to visit again :)","207":"I had visited this zoo many years ago, when my mobility issues were not as severe, and I think that left me with a rose-tinted memory of this zoo!It is INCREDIBLY steep, and just when you think you've reached the top, it keeps going at","208":"a sharper","209":"incline!The staff did offer a mobility transport shuttle to the top when I arrived (walking with my cane) but they described the zoo as \"being on a hill\", when really it feels more like Everest for the disabled!","210":"\ud83d\ude02I declined the shuttle, thinking I could just slowly make my way up.","211":"MISTAKE!It's a great little zoo, with plenty of animals and interesting exhibits, just heed my warning!Wheelchairs and mobility scooters are possible to rent from the front desk, and the Zoo Map has a number to call the shuttle to the top.","212":"If you have mobility issues, don't be like me, USE THEM!","213":"\ud83d\ude02","214":"You have been warned!A really disappointing day all round.","215":"Besides the \u00a355 for a couple to get in you're then presented with the most overpriced cafe.","216":"Three sandwiches, three mediocre coffees and a couple of kids packs.","217":"Grand total \u00a344.00.","218":"plus \u00a34.00 to park which as we were to find out was a bargain!A lot of the 'houses' are closed.","219":"The dinosaur animatronics aren't functioning plus most have been ravaged by time, with foam hanging out.","220":"If you're getting on a bit get a bus to the top and walk down as it's pretty steep.","221":"All in all for a \u00a3100 it's really taking the biscuit.","222":"So sad.","223":"It was great experience travelled from Birmingham to Edinburgh Zoe with family and grandchildren, great day out experience.","224":"Where do I begin.","225":"Firstly easy enough to park - cost of parking","226":"\u00a34- mind","227":"you","228":"i was there at 1000.Then had to queue at least 20 minutes to get in at a cost of \u00a329.50.","229":"It was only after I had paid that the young lady on the till informed me that it was a very steep climb to the top.","230":"No offer of transportation to get to top or even asked if I could manage - needless to say I\u2019ve yet to make it to the top - were probably scared on till that I\u2019d ask for a refund as not able to manage walk to top.","231":"Encloses- quite a few were either empty or very  need of good improvement to them.","232":"Best updated enclosure was the sloth and armadillo enclosure as it looked brand new.","233":"As for food - or lack there of - it was expensive - for a soggy ham, cheese and tomato panini and a coke \u00a39.95 for indigestion.","234":"On visiting Edinburgh zoo it reminds me me why I hate zoos but I keep thinking that this establishment will improve but I Live in hope.","235":"May I suggest that the owners of Edinburgh zoo either move this establishment to flatter ground and upgrade their facilities for the sake of the animals and members of the public.","236":"And also a visit to Chester zoo would give them an insight into how a zoo should be run.","237":"Great zoo with so many different animals.","238":"After parking - it was quick confusing where you go to get into the park - we were members so needed to find the members entrance.","239":"Once we located this - it was straight in.","240":"It was a little confusing which way to go - you kinda start in the middle - so we walked down hill and did everything there but then the walk to the top of the zoo if not for the faint hearted.","241":"It is horrendous for those with mobility, children in push chairs and elderly - there is also no provision that I could see to help with this - maybe a train and cable car would be great.","242":"The nice thing is that you can take the whole day to get to the top and take your time going back and forth as you view all the animals.","243":"Half way up there is a play park and picnic spot - it was a life saver - sat there for an hour to eat and chill.","244":"Then started the hike to the top -Please do not underestimate how steep this is in places, especially pushing a pram.","245":"That aside - it\u2019s a wonderful day out and well worth every penny.","246":"The staff are also super engaging","247":"Car park closed, no attendant on the gate to advise people where to go.","248":"The animals looked very depressed, it was too cold for them.","249":"This was more of animal prison than a zoo.","250":"Saw a lovely big monkey here.","251":"My cousin and I had a great day.","252":"Unfortunately he died on the train home but it was a cool trip.","253":"Went with 8 year old, haven't been since before Covid, but really enjoyed it.","254":"The park in general is on a hill, so lots of walking but pushchairs and wheelchairs are available, the park is clean and well maintained.","255":"We really wanted to see haggis, but apparently he's lazy and doesn't wake up till early afternoon, we went in 3 times to try and see him, but sadly only saw him asleep.","256":"We did find that lots of the animals are sleeping early, we arrived about 11, and saw more animals up and active in the afternoon.","257":"The chimps, big cats and giraffes were all worth the effort to see.","258":"The park has a few play parks of good value, a large one by the penguins and another near the chimps.","259":"We did want to see the penguin parade, online seemed to suggest it was still a thing, but couldn't work out if it was on.","260":"The QR code scanner didn't really answer the question, so we hung about hoping it was on, but sadly not.","261":"A nice bit sign would have been good!Meal wise we at at the grasslands, limited choices for my dairy free son.","262":"But portions were bit.","263":"\u00a322 for a hotdog and chips, a coffee and a kids pizza and chips for him.","264":"It does end up expensive, but it's a rare trip and I can't imagine it's cheap to keep a family of rhino's.","265":"When I was at Edinburgh Zoo today, we could at the Grasslands Restaurant.","266":"My  husband had a nourse bleed and the manager Rosa looked after him.","267":"Got him a fresh  coffee.","268":"She was caring and understanding.","269":"Just shose you that there is still people out there that are very, very good at their job ,and very caring.","270":"Thank you so much Rose.","271":"And all the staff10 out of 10.xx","272":"An absolute waste of time and money.","273":"Spent two and a half hours traipsing around to see a grand total of 4 different animals.","274":"Ridiculous.","275":"Desperately wanted to see a capybara (have been recovering from illness which almost killed me so this was my whole reason for travelling for 4 hours.)","276":"the capys were locked in a tiny room out of sight.","277":"Appalling waste!","278":"I understand the weather is cold, but If a zoo can\u2019t work as a zoo, close it until better weather instead on scamming people out of their hard earned money!","279":"We visited today and had a great time!","280":"Last time we were at the zoo was around 6-8 months ago, so it had been a while.","281":"We saw loads of animals and Haggis was a highlight!","282":"We had lunch in the Grasslands restaurant (again quite good), and bought some Haggis merch.","283":"Its not an inexpensive day out","284":"but we had a lovely day.","285":"Staff and volunteers always friendly!","286":"I visited about two years ago and from what I remember, I had a great day out.","287":"Decided to revisit with my mum as we were staying in Edinburgh.","288":"We got the No 26 bus from Princes Street and got off opposite the zoo.","289":"Received a warm welcome upon arrival.","290":"Staff were friendly.","291":"Cost almost \u00a360 for both of us, which seemed rather expensive.","292":"The zoo is situated on a hill so there are a lot steep slopes.","293":"I can imagine it would be challenging pushing someone in a wheelchair or if someone is physically challenged or has health issues.","294":"We went into The Gannet for lunch.","295":"Although the coffee was nice, the food and drinks were pricey.","296":"The Grasslands Restaurant and the Penguin Cafe were closed which was understandable as it's out of season.","297":"We were disappointed as many of the enclosures were empty or closed for refurbishment.","298":"I'm aware work needs to be done to ensure that the zoo is maintained but charging \u00a329 for an adult ticket is extortionate.","299":"The ticket price should be reduced in low season or if there is work carried out and some areas are closed.","300":"My mum and I felt like we were ripped off.","301":"Genuinely surprised how enjoyable our visit was.","302":"Took my 8 year old on a father son trip and we both had a really great time.","303":"Better than I had expected!Overall there were loads of interesting animals, almost all set up in a way that you could get a good or exciting view of them.","304":"We both were stopped in our tracks seeing the lions, tigers, zebras and giraffes in particular.","305":"Even where animals were sleeping you could often still get a good view of them through various observation windows.","306":"The one exception was Haggis, the celebrity baby pigmy hippo.","307":"In the end we had to visit the enclosure 3x to see Haggis live, with our 1st 2 stop offs being a little disappointing.","308":"I can\u2019t help but feel a viewing window or video screen with live webcam of the sleeping area would have helped give the hippos the peace they needed whilst also giving visitors a little something.","309":"Food; We had lunch at the Grasslands restaurant.","310":"For kids it was slightly \u201cbeige\u201d but was not outrageously priced for a tourist attraction, service was quick, the restaurant clean and my soup very nice.","311":"When the food arrived I didn\u2019t begrudge the spend but equally can understand why some would bring their own picnics.","312":"The zookeeper talks were quite fun and informative although it was a shame there were only 2 throughout the day, we would have happily visited more!One Warning: if you struggle with mobility maybe this isn\u2019t the zoo for you.","313":"Some paths are steep (although to be fair  they\u2019re marked as such on the free map)  and the whole zoo is situated on a hill.","314":"That said, we saw plenty of folks happily pushing prams around so don\u2019t be put off just because you have little ones.","315":"Tip: take at least 2 of the maps as you enter the zoo\u2026.","316":"Whilst the new maps may now be easier to recycle,  your average child navigating with one will have accidentally ripped it to shreds within the first 90mins.","317":"Fairly priced as it is a big zoo.","318":"A few animals were not available to see so this was disappointing but it was bitterly cold and still some snow on the ground.","319":"Very big zoo and wasn't too busy,definitely gives you a good work out .","320":"Think it would be better visiting when bit warmer.","321":"Giraffe talk was also good.","322":"All enclosure seemed to be big enough and animals seemed happy.","323":"Would definitely visit again in the warmer weather.","324":"We've been non-members for only about three years in the last quarter century, so maybe I'm biased.","325":"Makes for a great day out, even with 22 year-old kids :-)However, can't recommend the restaurant.","326":"First time I've paid over \u00a340 for a meal for three including a pizza with cheese that wasn't melted and a bowl of soup for my wife.","327":"My mixed bean loaded fries were good, though they were skin-on skinny fries, not wedges as advertised.","328":"All I can say is we all thought the coffees were good.","329":"Enjoyed seeing the penguins out of their enclosure - and lions and tigers inside their enclosure!","330":"Not only does this zoo host an amazing collection of animals and displays, you get a decent workout walking all around.","331":"So many highlights, right from the meerkats who greet you when you arrive to the artworks that dot the park.","332":"We were busy tracking our way around but there are heaps of playgrounds for families to break their walks.","333":"The zoo was underwhelming.","334":"It wasn't very exciting.","335":"There wasn't a lot to do except follow the trail and walk around.","336":"There were no guides and staff were not very helpful or accommodating.","337":"The zoo at Flamingo Land is much better, in my opinion.","338":"And more value for money.","339":"I had the most amazing day.","340":"We went to the tiger talk at the beginning and we spoke with keep Maurice who was great, informative and lovely to talk to.","341":"We later saw him at the waddle walk in the afternoon.","342":"DO NOT MISS THIS.","343":"It was the best thing I\u2019ve ever witness at a zoo\u2026 I\u2019ve worked at Longleat and I was very impressed with this idea.","344":"It was enjoyable, funny, and most importantly save for the penguins.","345":"We got lots of info about the penguins waddling by.","346":"It was fantastic!","347":"We laughed when we found out it was in a hill but that didn\u2019t matter to us.","348":"I believe they have support for those that need it.","349":"It was great to hear about the conservation and any keeper\/volunteer we spoke to were very passionate!","350":"We loved every mother.","351":"The giraffe house and chimp house were very impressive.","352":"We had a picnic that day so not sure what care was like.","353":"Gift shop was lovely and reasonable pricing!","354":"I got a little teddy penguin and magnet for under \u00a310.","355":"Ticket prices were fine, it all goes towards the lovely animal so we appreciate this a lot.","356":"The map was great and we planned our visit well.","357":"Some enclosures were empty but not too many.","358":"Some animals were not to be seen, but that was to be expected as they are not their to be on display!","359":"We loved every moment and I\u2019m so sad that I live far down south because I would definitely apply to be keeper or be a member.","360":"There was a lovely atmosphere and the staff were very lovely to talk to which just made it for us.","361":"Thank you Maurice for your talks.","362":"I will return one day!","363":"I will be looking out in the penguin cam.","364":"Visited on a Saturday in December.","365":"It wasn\u2019t as busy as we anticipated which was great.","366":"Parking is \u00a34 per car for the entire day but free for members.","367":"Only problem with it being off peak season was that a lot of the shops\/ cafes were shut which was a shame.","368":"We really enjoyed the penguin waddle which takes place at 14:15 at the weekends and we managed to see Haggis the new hippo.","369":"Only thing that did catch us off guard was how much of a slope the zoo is on.","370":"It\u2019s very steep and I can imagine would be very inaccessible for those who struggle to mobilise.","371":"The entire zoo is outside so luckily it didn\u2019t rain.","372":"We really enjoyed ourselves.","373":"Very disappointed to be honest so many empty enclosures we travelled a long way as we had heard it was the best zoo well we certainly didn't think so it's not a cheap day either.","374":"Nice place to visit also in the winter.","375":"I especially liked the lava, and I was lucky to see her move around.","376":"The animal assistant was good at telling us about the beautiful animal.","377":"There were also small, cute armadilloes running around on the ground.","378":"The tiger walked restlessly back and forth in front of the glass, I got a little hurt of it, it seemed uncomfortable.","379":"The goats were beautiful, the penguins and suricates were lovely and smart, and some of the penguins and the little monkeys were curious about us, and looked to thrive fine.","380":"Nice place to visit, there are a lot upstairs, so can be okay to know for those who are poor to bones.","381":"I didn\u2019t like having a 10% donation automatically added to the already expensive ticket price making it almost \u00a330 per person.","382":"This seems expensive compared to other zoos.","383":"It is winter so perhaps it it better in summer but the whole place looks tired and unkempt.","384":"It was cold so perhaps some of the animals were inside","385":"but we didn\u2019t actually see many animals.","386":"We saw one lonely rhino, one sad looking red panda and one sleeping tiger.","387":"What we saw more of was penguins, flamingos, giraffes and meerkats.","388":"Also three zebra and two anteaters.","389":"It seems that many of the enclosures are empty.","390":"Signage is poor- no sign to the top of the hill for example - and had we not followed other people up there we would not have got to the giraffes.","391":"A properly marked trail so you get to see everything and don\u2019t go down dead ends would be so much better.","392":"Thank goodness we had a paper map otherwise it would have been hopeless.","393":"The view from the top is lovely.","394":"The sun was shining and it was picturesque.","395":"Some of the enclosures look as though they have had a lot of money spent on them like the penguins and the giraffes.","396":"Others don\u2019t.","397":"A lot of the pools were empty.","398":"The rhino just had a lot of mud and he was pacing over the empty concrete pool.","399":"I have seen much better zoos around the world and this one left me feeling a bit sad for the animals.","400":"Edinburgh Zoo is always a great day out, even in freezing cold weather!","401":"I always recommend Edinburgh zoo to anyone coming to Edinburgh or even a local friend who\u2019s a bit bored.","402":"Ever time we visit we start by walked up the hill and herring the hard part out of the way first, which I recommend.","403":"Edinburgh zoo has so many animals too see, and we even saw wee haggis!The reasons why I couldn\u2019t give our day out a five star are as follows:The signage wasn\u2019t great and it\u2019s easy to miss parts out.","404":"Also in some areas the signs were either faded off or had withered away partially and weren\u2019t clear.","405":"We had lunch at the grasslands caf\u00e9 and the food was lovely, the only problem was that the staff kept getting confused and couldn\u2019t figure out things like table numbers and brought our food round several other tables before us.","406":"Also there was quite a queue for tables and I think it might have been good if you could reserve tables, especially for people with accessibility needs.","407":"Another thing that would have improved our visit would have been if there was maybe some adults only areas (just one small corner or something) as it can get very overstimulating with screaming kids everywhere!!","408":"A good morning spent walking around the zoo, we are members of Chester zoo so our visit was free of entry charges which was a bonus.","409":"The zoo is on many levels so a few hills steeper than others, but on the whole accessible to most people.","410":"We did see people on mobility scooters but unsure if they rent these out here!The bus service is right outside the doors but they also had a car parkOn the whole a decent few hours spent","411":"Great zoo.","412":"Animals looked well cared for.","413":"Very hilly so be prepared for that.","414":"Penguin Waddle was the best but for us!","415":"Food was good there in the restaurant too.","416":"The volunteer by the penguins was very knowledgeable and I was delighted to see Nils Olav upon visiting.","417":"Good selection of species on display, although I think the Wee Beasties section could do with some more attention.","418":"Loved our visit.","419":"My boyfriend loves zoos so he really enjoyed.","420":"Be warned it is very hilly so definitely use the map and plan your route to avoid unnecessary hill climbs.","421":"Probably takes about 4-5h to enjoy the experience without feeling rushed.","422":"The lego animals are great.","423":"Great trip to the zoo.","424":"We saw lots of animals and some like the penguins and zebra were very active which was fun.","425":"Ate looking at the penguins good choices but seating was very full inside.","426":"Lovely friendly and informative staff.","427":"All in all a very enjoyable day.","428":"What a great zoo.","429":"We were there 5 hours and just about managed to see it all.","430":"Best penguin area that I have ever seen.","431":"Zoo is on a steep hill and can be hard going in places, but we just took it slowly.","432":"They do hire scooters for visitors with mobility issues - great","433":"ideaWill definitely return again if in Edinburgh","434":"A great day at Edinburgh zoo.","435":"A very well kept zoo with lots of animals.","436":"Good facilities & food.","437":"The staff & volunteers absolutely made our trip.","438":"They were all so friendly, approachable & knowledgeable.","439":"Would definitely recommend a visit.","440":"The zoo is still such a calm and lovely spot for families and friends alike.","441":"Loved the exhibits in the magic forest and penguin rock!","442":"We were shown a lot of things by Sophie who had what felt like a bottomless well of information!","443":"She was so lovely and helpful about good times to visit some of the enclosures, got to see a very handsome Rhino thanks to her suggestion!Would love to be able to catch some of the animals that were a bit more reclusive this visit next time.","444":"Will definitely be back.","445":"A warm sunny October day, 2 adults and 3 teens, loved the penguins and giraffes and monkeys, didn't see any big cats...","446":"couldn't","447":"find them, no sign of the  pallas cats, lots of uphill walking, was hoping for a lemur walkway to get close but no.","448":"Food\/drink bit expensive as is usual at attractions like this, bit disappointed if im honest, probably won't go again.","449":"Amazing views from the top of this zoo where the giraffes are.","450":"Very hilly but worth the trip.","451":"A good selection of animals.","452":"We took a pack lunch and there were a lot of places to sit and eat it including benches.","453":"Visited today as a couple away for the weekend ,We had a great day loved the giraffes    and penguins the most ,Autumn has set in so grounds looking a bit sad now , animals look in til top condition ,Toilets really need some TLC the shop they are shocking ,Anyone  with any walking difficulties beware this place has very steep walks and climbs up to see the big animalsAll in all we enjoyed our day thank you","454":"We are RZSS members and often visit Edinburgh Zoo.","455":"We were pleased with this morning's chance to get very close to some unusual animals in the Wicked Encounters space in the Budongo Trail building.","456":"We're sure it takes a lot of resources to plan and staff the site but it was very popular (lots of big eyes on children).","457":"We hope Wicked Encounters will continue beyond the autumn.","458":"Disappointed that there were no snakes ,elephants , crocodiles and a lot of empty spaces.","459":"The plus side was the tigers ,lion , penguins, giraffes .","460":"Last visited in the 1960s but needs a lot of work now.","461":"A very nice zoo to get to comfortably by bus..animals that enjoy large well-kept spaces.","462":"Very nice couple of tigers and very nice penguin parade","463":"Very nice day.","464":"The day was cloudy and cold, but I enjoyed it.","465":"Very large enclosures for a few animals, I found the thing very positive, so much space for a few specimens.","466":"It was nice to get into the kangaroo enclosure.","467":"The map is essential because the zoo is really big.","468":"Visit Recommendation, and Recommendation to be there by 2pm in time for the Penguin Parade, which is great fun.","469":"Avoid at all costs is our review.","470":"Waste of time and money and a day of our holiday which could have been spent better.","471":"I am realistic not to expect the animals to be standing in the centre of the cage or open space but it really was spot the animal competition!More empty cages and open closure's than full.","472":"A bad advert for Edinburgh and Scotland.","473":"If you do go take your own food,two hot drinks and two sandwiches for \u00a318!!!!What a rip off.","474":"Take our advice,go to Chester Zoo, this is a sorry state of a zoo.","475":"At least the bus was easy to get back to Edinburgh city centre.","476":"Awful, Animal Magic this is not.","477":"Excellent day out, staff were extremely helpful.","478":"I have a mobility scooter and there was a bus for people with mobility issues to get on to take them to the top of the zoo as the hill is very steep.","479":"I recommend getting one of the zoos own mobility scooters as my standard scooter struggled on the hills as a few steep ones.","480":"You can also ring the zoo staff if your own scooter runs of batterie and they can bring you one of there\u2019s.","481":"Apart from the Pygmy hippo enclosure which I unfortunately got my scooter stuck in as the floor was made of wood chip, every where else was accessible.","482":"Throughly enjoyed my day and all the animals looked very happy and healthy.","483":"A great day out for a young family with a toddler (18mths)!Okay, so this is a very hilly zoo!","484":"so make sure when you plan your day you\u2019re going up to the top seeing everything you need to see and then coming down.","485":"You can see on the map where the hills are, so just make sure you keep this in mind.","486":"Giraffes for example at the very top of the hill which means you get amazing views from the top but just make sure you\u2019re not continuously going up and down ideally plan to go up the hill before lunch so you have plenty of time to see everything you need to before coming down for food.","487":"The zoo itself is a really great zoo, loads of amazing animals to see and really good enclosures.","488":"They have a really great area for the chimpanzees, with really great viewing platforms where you can watch them playing and having fun.","489":"The exhibition is also really great for viewing the giraffes and seeing them up close  and safely.","490":"I think the zoo did a really good job of making a lot of the viewing areas accessible to smaller children, so I didn\u2019t often have to lift my toddler up to see.","491":"The penguin exhibition was a great example of this when my toddler actually ended up standing right next to a penguin through the glass , which she loved.","492":"The food at the fish bar was understandably quite pricey, but you actually got a great portion size for the money and the quality was very good.","493":"Despite going as a cold time of year it was still extremely easy to see all the animals.","494":"Not a lot of them were outside but the indoor closures were well maintained and it was still easy to see them.","495":"It did rain at points but there was a lot of errors undercover, especially the chimpanzee area which had a hole inside a bit that was completely completely undercover and nice and warm.","496":"Arrived just after lunchtime (Sat 7th Sept)  and most of the places selling food were closedHad popped into the ice cream kiosk at the Penguin House and said we would be back after grabbing a coffee from the cafe next door.","497":"When we returned a few minutes later is was closed.","498":"Staff could have said at the time they were closing at a certain time as we clearly stated we would be back so the children were (and the adults) were very disappointed and hungryBy the time we reached the top of the hill the kids wanted to go home and get something to eatSeeing most animals as expected but felt it fell a bit short and the experience was marred by the poor customer service although conversely the welcome at reception was top notch","499":"Brilliant day out with all the family.","500":"I seem to remember there being a wee train in the past that took you up the hill (maybe I am imagining) as our youngest (4) struggled with the walking round and up hill so would have been good.","501":"Animals all looked very well cared for: we loved the flamingoes and the anteater!","502":"If you see everything it really does take all day so would say arrive early.","503":"We got the bus there easily straight from ingliston.","504":"As a local mum with a toddler and baby on the way, I was looking for something fun to do whilst off on maternity leave.","505":"So far I would highly recommend the annual adult membership, it is \u00a36.40 a month.","506":"Kids under 3 are free! :-)","507":"It gives you free parking and money off on food & drink.","508":"I can visit as many times as I like for a year.","509":"The membership also gives your guests money off the admission if they are not members which I haven't used yet so not sure of the price.","510":"The membership allows you access from a gate at the top of the carpark also to save waiting in any queues in the main entrance area.","511":"The zoo is set on a hill side which can be hard whilst pregnant and pushing a buggy.","512":"The very kind reception staff can organise a van to take you to the top of the hill so you can work your way down which is just amazing!","513":"The driver also gives you lots of information on the way up about the names of animals etc.","514":"The staff were very helpful and lovely to us.","515":"However, it would be hard going up hill with the buggy as some places are quite steep.","516":"As for the verity of animals, it's great.","517":"My 15month old toddler can even spot them.","518":"We have visited in the rain and there are lots of indoor enclosures to hide in.","519":"The paths are great for a toddler to run around and peak in the enclosures and plenty of buggy friendly zones.","520":"There are lots of places to sit and have a picnic too which is great, saves buying food on every visit.","521":"So far, very happy with the membership and we are excited to return regularly.","522":"Fab place the animals are all well looked after, the park is clean and tidy the kids and family and friends loved it.","523":"Reception staff friendly and it\u2019s very easy to get to the zoo!","524":"Visited the zoo for the first time in a couple of years and was disappointed.","525":"The whole zoo seemed tired and run down, with so many empty enclosures.","526":"Penguins and giraffes were great but for the entry price it\u2019s not worth it.","527":"It\u2019s a shame.","528":"Really good for a solo visit or a family day out.","529":"The staff were really helpful and very informed.","530":"It is also great to know that quite a large number of endangered species are being looked after to safeguard their extinction.","531":"There is an entrance fee, but I didn\u2019t consider it excessive.","532":"I was there at 11:30 in the morning and didn\u2019t leave until four in the afternoon, so it is a full day experience.","533":"Family visit of 4 adults and 3 children of primary school age, we had a brilliant day.","534":"The staff were amazing, and the talks we attended were interesting and informative, we all learned things we didn't know before!","535":"Great facilities for picnics, and on the bus home we realised we had been there for 7 hours!","536":"The sloths and red pandas were our favourite, but then we saw the rhino have a bath and splashing around happily, so that might have just overtaken!We are all fit and healthy, the steep slopes might be a bit much for those with littler legs, but there are rented strollers available","537":"This great zoo is spread across a hillside.","538":"Best to be in good shape for all the climbing.","539":"The penguin exhibit is wonderful with some coming up and posing for audience attention.","540":"Meercats and giraffes were great photo-ops.","541":"As a RZSS member I have visited this Zoo many times over the years, and I would normally give Edinburgh Zoo (and the wider RZSS) a 5 star review any day of the week.","542":"I have even been lucky enough to meet some of the more famous members of staff such as Alison and Darren, who were very kind and helpful, as well as being open to questions.","543":"In recent months I really like Lego sculptures that were added around the Zoo, and were excellent to see - Its just a shame that they were only temporary.","544":"In the past I have also enjoyed events such as the Great Lanterns of China etc, I feel its a shame that the Zoo doesn't seem to do as many of these events anymore, although I was also lucky enough to attend some of the Panda themed events last summer which were very highly sought after.","545":"This leads into my point as to partly why I am giving the Zoo an 'average' rating, I feel that the RZSS\/Zoo could have done more to try and keep their Pandas a bit longer, or at least - attempt to replace them, which has happened at a number of Zoos around the world such as Vienna , Adelaide (Australia) and Washington etc.","546":"While we were lucky to have them for an extra 2 years during Covid, I feel like they were a very big draw for Edinburgh Zoo , and even the gift shop does not stock Panda items anymore, even though they are still fondly remembered by regular Zoo goers such as myself, in a similar way that Wendy the elephant in Bristol is remembered, even though Bristol Zoo is no longer even an entity.","547":"In short, while it may not be entirely their fault - I feel a bit disappointed by the current leadership of Edinburgh Zoo with regards to this.","548":"My second point is the cessation of the Penguin Walk, which was another big draw for this Zoo - and another element that made it memorable and unique (In the same way the Pandas did) , Initially the Penguin Walk was stopped at the beginning of Covid, but 5 years on - It seems the RZSS have no desire to bring it back with it simply being 'postponed' on their website, I dont know if this is because of insurance issues but i think the RZSS need to be honest as to why they have decided the Penguin Walk wont be coming back , I am aware that there are also no outbreaks of bird flu in Scotland since summer 2023 either.","549":"I do understand that they will be some new animals coming to the Zoo (such as the Cheetah and hopefully, a new species of bear) which is great, however, to reiterate I feel the Zoo has taken the wrong approach to some of the recent issues in my review, and in my view - Its partly why the Zoo does seem to be less busy than it used to be in years gone by, which is a shame because as a long term member I want to see it succeed.","550":"Great day out.","551":"Saw most of animals.","552":"A lot of steep walking though.","553":"Came last year and was excited to come bk.","554":"Kids went free with Blue Peter badges which was a big bonus","555":"A fabulous day out for the kids.","556":"There are plenty of helpful staff and volunteers to help make things go smoothly around the various enclosures.","557":"There are a number of food venues throughout the park and all of a small nature.","558":"The food on offer is not the cheapest but reasonable for this type of venue.","559":"Elderly or visitors who find it difficult to walk on steep terrain will need to take in consideration how to cope with this as the whole venue is on the side of a steep hill.","560":"Overall a great place to visit.","561":"There is parking adjacent to the entrance to the zoo.","562":"We visited after my son saw the zoo on Blue Peter - he especially wanted to see the penguins as the baby penguins were a big element of the show.","563":"My son got in for free with his Blue Peter badge and card, and we had an amazing day.","564":"We were slightly worried about parking, but there was plenty and when we entered the zoo a friendly member of staff greeted us and showed us a map, as well as explaining which areas were being worked on at the moment.","565":"The Penguins were a highlight, but we also loved the Monkeys (we were lucky enough to stumble across a talk with one of the keepers there), as well as the Cheetah and the Sun Bear.","566":"The staff were all really friendly and knowledgeable - especially the volunteers who seemed to be stationed at various enclosures around the zoo.","567":"My son also enjoyed the Dinosaur area.","568":"We had a picnic at the area near the Dinosaurs and also went in the Penguin Cafe for coffee and cake, which was lovely.","569":"We loved our day and would definitely recommend the zoo.","570":"This is our second visit to the zoo and enjoyed it as much as the first time, 7 years ago.","571":"We saw nearly all the animals which was brilliant.","572":"It is a very hilly terrain but that does add to its charm.","573":"One of our favourite zoos to visit.","574":"The animals look healthy and have large enclosures but as the larger enclosures have various viewing spots it makes it easier to spot the animals.","575":"We spent over 4 hours at the zoo and all enjoyed.","576":"I visited recently after having not visited for over 20 years.","577":"There was plenty of parking, and The Holiday Inn Hotel right next door to the zoo is a new addition to my previous visit, very convenient if visiting the zoo.","578":"I do disagree with the car park charge however, on top of already very expensive admission.","579":"The toilets in the car park leave a lot to be desired however, only two and they were not very clean sadly.","580":"It was great to see such a variety of animals in the zoo, however there was a lot of climbing of steep hills.","581":"I can imagine elderly and disabled people struggling with this aspect, as well as having to push prams and pushchairs uphill.","582":"There were plenty of family picnic areas.","583":"I ate at The Gannet Restaurant with my family, however my mother and I are gluten-free, and we could only have soup.","584":"The zoo is incredibly limited in terms of food for gluten-free people","585":"so I suggest that you take your own as the restaurant certainly was not cheap.","586":"The chips were advertised as 'chip shop' however they certainly did not taste like it, completely dried out.","587":"I love photography and there were some great opportunities.","588":"A new addition to my last visit is a collection of dinosaurs with sound effects which children seemed to really enjoy.","589":"Hi all, visited Edinburgh zoo on our trip to Scotland.","590":"I absolutely love zoos and aquariums, i have done since i was little and i had high hopes.","591":"I\u2019ve visited so many zoos and wildlife parks over the years and Edinburgh zoo is apparently supposed to be one of the best in the UK.","592":"How wrong that is.","593":"Has nothing on Chester Zoo and other places i\u2019ve been to.","594":"I think any normal person would go to a zoo to see the actual animals rather than an array of shrubbery and trees upon trees.","595":"I am all for a very well looked after environment which the animals feel as though they\u2019re in what seems like their natural habitat and feel safe and happy, i\u2019m a lover of animals.","596":"Although the amount of cr*p in the tiger enclosures, the red panda and monkey enclosures is abit much.","597":"So much so that the animals can\u2019t even be seen, i was so disappointed :(","598":"Again i\u2019d like to reiterate that the treatment of the animals there was beautiful, and i am ALWAYS for a very safe happy and nourishing environment.","599":"Next thing is the toilets\u2026 the floors were covered in urine and absolutely stunk.","600":"There were young children in there holding their noses, parents were ushering them to come out due to the smell.","601":"The last and most important thing to warn people about is the terrain\u2026 the whole zoo is on a huge hill, for me, it was okay, but my older grandparents who wanted to see all the animals were completely unable to due to the steep hills, this isn\u2019t an exaggeration.","602":"If anyone has any mobility or walking issues, please be aware of this, as this may limit the amount of animals you see and hinder your experience.","603":"We've been looking forward to going to the zoo so much and the experience matched our expectations or possibly surpassed them.","604":"We saw almost all the animals, some of them gave us a special performance like the tiger who was dozing at first but then started licking himself or the lion who also was at first having a rest but then got up, came very close to the screen and soon after even gave quite the roars (though maybe because in the meantime many people had gathered to look at him).","605":"We loved every bit of it.","606":"There was also a little drama with one my 5 year old son's favourite toys which fell near where the zebras are and the situation was dealt in an amazingly quick and professional manner.","607":"The person I spoke to was as accommodating as possible and very positive - simply brilliant.","608":"The whole place has a great vibe and we're definitely going to go back.","609":"The zoo is run down, the site doesn\u2019t have adequate signage so its easy to miss things.","610":"Could barely see any animals due to the lay out and overgrown enclosures.","611":"Staff in the food places were very rude and the prices were a rip off.","612":"Screaming parents and children everywhere (granted not the zoo\u2019s fault).Overall the day wasn\u2019t a disaster but its certainly not what I was expecting and I wouldn\u2019t go back.","613":"This is the first time I have ever visited Edinburgh Zoo, & to be honest I found it a little disappointing.","614":"Some of the animal environments looked poor, the majority of the animals did not appear to be thriving.","615":"I saw cans & rubbish that had been dropped into some of the animal enclosures.","616":"The general grounds appeared to be poorly maintained, & many areas were overgrown.","617":"I wouldn\u2019t go again or recommend it anyone.","618":"I felt very disappointed in our day out to Edinburgh zoo,the zoo appears very run down a lot of enclosures with no animals in them,I felt there were no elephants,leopards,jaggers,polar bears and the pandas have gone back to China,hey no longer do the penguin walk,I felt \u00a387 for 3 of us was very steep,when there were so little animals,and most of the animals that are thete you can see in a lot of places now,we went into a cafe onsite for 3 coffees and a cake \u00a318, and \u00a34 fr car parking,very expensive day out for what it was,I will not be rushing back.","619":"Fantastic Zoo.","620":"Feel the staff could have had more interaction with public.","621":"\u00a385 for two adults and two kids is very steep.","622":"I fully appreciate the running of the zoo however won\u2019t be a return from us anytime soon due to this.","623":"Also ice creams ect super expensive too.","624":"Go prepared picnic juice ect.","625":"Comfy shoes too there\u2019s lots of walking and steep hills.","626":"This zoo is excellent!","627":"There are lots of different animals and we had a super family day out.","628":"The entrance queueing was a bit confusing but once past that point it was great.","629":"Staff were all really friendly!","630":"Very nice zoo.","631":"Clean and tidy.","632":"Large, well kept enclosures.","633":"Only a couple of animals that hid from view.","634":"Really nice store on way out.","635":"Pleasant and helpful staff.","636":"Be warned, the zoo is on a very steep hill.","637":"I was so happy not to have a buggy.","638":"Seeing the koalas made my day \u2764\ufe0f\ud83c\udff4\udb40\udc67\udb40\udc62\udb40\udc73\udb40\udc63\udb40\udc74\udb40\udc7f","639":"We visited from the North East of England for the day & had such a brilliant time.","640":"The Zoo is huge.","641":"Has such a wide range of animals & plenty of facilities, photo opportunities and play parks along the way.","642":"You can easily spend a day there.","643":"What I was particularly impressed with & have actually fed back to the Zoo, was the customer service from the staff.","644":"Every single staff member we encountered throughout the day are an absolute credit to the team at EZ.They were polite, helpful & full of interesting information.","645":"Nothing was a bother to any of them.","646":"From arriving and purchasing our tickets, to the lovely worker that stopped what she was doing to take our photo & show an interest in our day, the face painter who had a great sense of humour, the numerous staff around to answer questions about the animals, and the girl that served us in the gift shop, that really made an effort to talk to our children about their favourite part of the day & compliment them on their face painting.","647":"I could go on but I\u2019d be here all day\u2026Although it seems like such a small but natural thing to do, a lot of places just don\u2019t","648":"but it really really makes a difference & adds to your experience.","649":"Overall a great day had by all.","650":"Would recommend 1000%.","651":"Not worth what we paid for this experience in comparison to some of the other things we dud in Edinburgh with our grandsons.","652":"A lot of the animals were not visible if they actually existed.","653":"There is no logical path to follow so easy to miss things.","654":"The cafes are a total rip off \u00a32.25 for a CAN of coke!","655":"Thought I had missed out all the times I have been to Edinburgh but sadly not.","656":"Been to better!","657":"Not the best zoo we've been to by any stretch, but then we've been to some of the best, like Durrell Zoo in Jersey, Barcelona, London, Twycross, West Midlands Safari Park, Cheshire and Yorkshire Wildlife Park; the last 3 being up there as our top 3.It needs updating, most of the enclosures are small, tired and overgrown, and you can not see the animals; which makes the visit feel depressing overall.","658":"The signage could be better, we found we had to walk up and down a few times, and as the zoo is on one big hill, this is tiring.","659":"I emailed after our visit to ask if there were plans to reinvest, and no one replied.","660":"It being in Edinburgh, the footfall is huge, so there really isn't any excuse for this in my opinion.","661":"As residents, we\u2019ve been to the zoo a fair few times the last being around 4\/5 years ago.","662":"The zoo is clean and tidy and the animals are clearly well cared for.","663":"We took our own picnic and found plenty of nice spots to sit down to have lunch\/snacks.","664":"Unfortunately I really do feel now that the zoo is definitely not value for money.","665":"I fully appreciate we\u2019re paying the way for development\/research of these beautiful animals but at almost \u00a327 admission per adult it\u2019s a very average experience.","666":"The cafes around the zoo are way overpriced, and I speak of food, drink, ice cream, everything!","667":"(\u00a32.25 for a can of juice!!","668":"\u00a33.95 for a coffee!","669":"\u00a33.99 for a slice of cake!)The gift shop is also full of incredibly overpriced goods which makes it very hard for families with wee ones to buy any type of souvenir without spending a fortune.","670":"Sadly, we\u2019ll be in no hurry to return.","671":"\ud83d\udc2f\ud83e\udd81\ud83d\udc28\ud83e\udd92\ud83c\udf33","672":"My partner wanted to visit Edinburgh Zoo for her birthday, so I booked us a keeper experience!","673":"We were on a relatively low budget so I went for the Close Encounters Magic Moments that came in at \u00a349 per person, the best \u00a398 I have ever spent in my life!!The price includes entry to the zoo which was perfect as our experience was in the late afternoon, giving us the day to explore the magic of the zoo before hand.","674":"My partner is a wheelchair user, we were able to leave her wheelchair at our hotel and hire a mobility scooter for her with ease.","675":"We did catch the last one available at around 11 am so I would recommend going early to take advantage of this top class service.","676":"The scooter itself was very easy for my partner to control and very impressively handled the terrain of the zoo with no issues!The zoo is beautiful, well kept, the animals are all very happy, have plenty of space and are well fed.","677":"The majority of them (if not all) are rescued or for verious reasons would not survive in the wild and if you were lucky enough to spot someone else's keeper experience or spot a zoo keeper feeding or interacting with the animals, you could tell the animals were very social and have a good relationship with their carers!Me and my partner both agree that outwith our Close Encounters experience, our favourite part of the zoo its self is the Rainforst Enclosure where they keep the sloths, who if you are lucky enough, might just carry themselves right over your head!","678":"The enclosure feels very open and intimate while giving the sloths all the safe space they need!Now on to the experience!!","679":"We were met at the meeting point by Lynsey (who is an absolute credit to the zoo) and taken to wee beasties where we had the honor of meeting a female pancake tortoise.","680":"Lynsey told us everything we needed to know, including how these animals ended up in the zoo, and answered all and any questions!","681":"Next we got to hold and learn all about one of the stick insects.","682":"Last but not least we returned to our favourite enclosure - the rainforest encloser where we got to meet Patcha the armadillo who we both had our hearts stolen by!!","683":"Again Lysney was incredibly informative about Patcha and about armadillos in general and told us all about the different spieces and of their adventures studying these wonderful creatures!","684":"Lynsey and the experience were a pure joy, I know what I will be asking my partner for when my birthday comes up next year!!I couldn't recommend the zoo or the experience enough!","685":"If you have been wondering if the price is worth it, I would honestly say they are under selling this one!!","686":"I will note, the prices for things like drinks and snacks is high (I would recommend bringing your own if you are on a budget) but for the value we got out of the experience, I didn't see it as an issue and I was happy to pay it knowing it supports this wonderful zoo!!","687":"Friends treated me to Edinburgh zoo for my birthday as I was visiting Scotland for the week I had a great time here I loved seeing all the different animals despite the weather it didn\u2019t ruin my day at all","688":"The zoo is a lovely place for a visit, the animals are all healthy, the zoo its self is a bit hilly, but you can book a bus from the bottom near the entrance to the top of the hill and walk back down, that is what we did","689":"This is one of my top three favorite zoos I\u2019ve ever visited.","690":"I was so thrilled to see how immaculate the habitats are and how well taken care of the animals are!","691":"Every animal\u2019s habitat was clean, spacious, and had tons of enrichment.","692":"Every animal looked so happy and content!","693":"Most were even moving around, which you don\u2019t always get to see!","694":"You could spend HOURS here.","695":"I\u2019m a huge animal enthusiast and there were multiple animals there that I\u2019ve never seen or heard of, which was a huge treat!Being able to watch the primate research and get to close to most animals was special.","696":"I will always come back if I\u2019m in town and would highly recommend this to anyone who is in the area.","697":"Visited for my birthday Thoroughly enjoyed my visit, there were a few enclosures where we couldn\u2019t see any animals and trust me we looked lol (no signs to say empty enclosure)","698":"We understand there were some that were signposted empty so you knew to avoid them also couldn\u2019t understand why you would have Lego figure's of animals that you don\u2019t have at the Zoo \ud83e\udd14apart from the Loch Ness Monster of courseSeemed very untidy as there was were Rubbish on the floor all over and there is no way that happened on the day as we arrived early ?","699":"So overall looking a bit run down especially around the Penguin pool Enjoyed our visit but probably wouldn\u2019t come back again unfortunatelyAlso the map and signs could do with updating, Panda sign still up and the map could do with maybe being numbered to save you going up and down","700":"As I live beside Belfast Zoo I thought as we were away on holiday to Edinburgh we would try the Zoo here.","701":"Not impressed at all.","702":"To be very honest.","703":"The only thing I liked was the penguins.","704":"The rest of the entire place was completely overated.","705":"You can't seem most of the animals.","706":"Also it's an absolute rip off.","707":"It cost 97pounds for 2 adults and 2 children.","708":"Then they charge you 4 pounds to park.","709":"Incredible.","710":"My advice is avoid.","711":"I really enjoyed the Zoo.","712":"i have been to many Zoos aorund the country and in the Europe and I find it the top on my list.","713":"I could see red pandas, koalas, Przewalski horse, had a close look of giraffes etc all animals that you cant see inany zoos.","714":"Loved it so much","715":"Admission for the zoo now so expensive.","716":"Walking around the zoo looks very untidy and not well maintained.","717":"Even penguin rock now needs to be refurbished.","718":"Only good thing was the lego exhibit","719":"The worst zoo i have ever been in","720":"and ive see  many Poorly designed and boring, except pandas and pinguins\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026..","721":"It's one of the best zoos we've visited.","722":"It was fantastic to see all the animals around.","723":"We literally saw every single animal during the day.","724":"However, penguins were super entertaining, and we spent most of our day at the Penguin rock :)","725":"It was fantastic to see koalas as we had never seen it before.","726":"All staff were really friendly and helpful.","727":"We had a fantastic day with our zookeeper experience, our mentor Charlie was a great host and really helped make us comfortable with being at close (but safe!)","728":"quarters with the beautiful animals-","729":"a must do if you get the chance !!","730":"Visited here for my first stop on a trip to Edinburgh and glad I did.","731":"The entry fee is very reasonable, as is the parking of which there is loads, just make sure you go early!The Red Pandas and penguins were my highlights.","732":"Most of the enclosures let you see from multiple angles so there's no annoying arriving at an enclosure to see it looking empty.","733":"Loads of talks by the keepers and other helpers around the zoo which is really nice to see and really informative.","734":"The penguin enclosure is fantastic and you get to see them from every angle.","735":"They have a wide range from rock hoppers to emperor penguins!Be warned there are some steep climbs to the top to see some of the animals but there are mobility scooters for hire and transport up to higher parts if needed.","736":"Sun cream and water is essential as there is very little shade.","737":"My daughter did the 10am Sloth Experience and we had the enclosure to ourselves.","738":"After putting on wellie boots, she was able to feed one of the sloths with a food grabber and the keeper was very friendly and informative.","739":"We were able to get loads of photos and all our questions were answered - we learnt loads about sloths.","740":"This experience included a zoo ticket for my daughter and we managed to spend 7 hours after the experience taking our time walking around the very hilly zoo (wear comfy shoes) and seeing all the animals on the map (always worth going back at a later time as the animals might be in a better place for viewing).","741":"We ate at one of the restaurants - a bit pricey but very nice food.","742":"All the keepers we saw around the zoo were very chatty and keen to tell us about the animals.","743":"A great day out and my daughter loved her special sloth experience.","744":"Spent half a day at the zoo.","745":"Our six year old loved all the legos, and enjoyed checking out the penguins and koalas the most.","746":"The magical forest was great also because we saw baby monkeys on their parents backs.","747":"A little disappointed because we missed seeing the tiger and the wildcat, but overall a great family day trip.","748":"Definitely recommend!","749":"Lovely zoo, grabbed the free zoo map and ticked off every animal as I went.","750":"Penguins were great to see, so were the koala bears - only ever seen them \"live\" once and that was at San Diego.","751":"Yes is on a hill (steep and steeper !)","752":"so comfortable walking shoes definitely needed.","753":"Animals all looked really good and spent a good couple of hours there.","754":"Booked on-line the morning I went as a few \u00a3\u00a3 off the normal price.","755":"Got a bus from the airport which stops directly outside the zoo, then a local bus into Edinburgh centre \/ waverley station for \u00a32 - really easy.","756":"Can recommend.","757":"Took a day trip with teenage son who wanted to get some good photo opportunities having recently taken up his new hobby.","758":"So many animals to see, beautiful well-kept grounds, toilets all clean and plenty of places available for snacks \/ drinks.","759":"Highly recommended, to me it was well worth the entrance fee and the staff we encountered were all lovely.","760":"Great place to go for a day out.","761":"28,000 steps done so be warned!","762":"Have been to Edinburgh Zoo plenty of times before, but had not been for a few years so ventured again with my partner, and it's just as I remember it for the most part.","763":"Overall it is great, there are issues of course, it is a zoo, and an old one, inside a city on the side of a steep hill...in Scotland, so you have to judge it based on that.","764":"Most of the work done by the zoo these days is as it should be, conservation, research for the protection of animals, that are in various stages of endangered and education for kids and adults alike, rather than the old stuff animals somewhere for people to come look at them, which belongs in the past.","765":"The biggest issues with the Zoo are from the non \"animal people\" side, it is tired in a lot of places, info signs that don't apply anymore, or very worn so you can't read them, the condition of paths in a fair few places matches some of the roads, being very uneven, nothing can be done with them being steep, the zoo is where it is but broken up surfaces are not good to deal with, I have issues with my hip and ankle and while taking time, resting every now and again I was able to enjoy a nice wander around, the dud path surface in places was very annoying, and can see being a bigger problem for people with more mobility issues.","766":"The general signage around the zoo is pretty poor, the signs are there but are often hidden by the surrounding vegetation or not really pointing in a helpful direction, and plenty of little side paths that are unmarked and get a little maze like, some better signage or even painted on the ground would make travel around it easier.","767":"The on site food\/drink, well they have outsourced it all, it's on the expensive side, card only, which isn't really a good choice for the type of venue it is, many tourists, familys, older people etc.","768":"with all of the little kiosks being shut, one of the main restaurants being staff only... which the management had not bothered to even put a sign outside for, waited for people dodging the rain and waiting for people, obviously staff to be severed before being told sorry staff only, very polite and pointed out where to go etc but the Management on duty should have made a proper effort to make it known to people before standing there like a lemonOutsourcing to a large company like Compass, while I am sure it makes things a lot easier for the zoo as a whole, in \"The Gannet\" you have to use a smartphone to order?","769":"In some Trendy tech offices\/bar etc  by all means, not an issue for me but this is a zoo, you have paper menus at least have a cash desk to order at for those that want to, even spoons can manage to have an app and the normal way of doing things.","770":"Card only, again not a problem for me, and for most part unless its a smaller independent business, rarely use cash but given that plenty of people who will want to use the zoo, many not always have card, tourists and elderly people being prime examples you are alienating them, and its not advertised till you get in seems a little unfair...","771":"Its perfectly legal and getting more common these days (and no \"legal tender\" does not mean what you think it does to whoever wants to rant that one)Most being shut, well it was a wet thursday in early June, but at least open one at the top of the hill for people who might want a drink etc after climbing up.","772":"All in, its still a great day out","773":"but maybe some of the higher ups, need to touch back down to earth a little, quite a few things combined will definitely alienant some groups of people for no real reason","774":"For a zoo that is over 120 years old you would think that they could have sort the design and flow.","775":"The zoo is upside down you start at the bottom walk up hill then have to walk down hill to exit.","776":"If the entrance was at the top and you walk down or have a skyway to top would solve the design issues.","777":"I felt so sorry for parents pushing strollers up some very steep hills.","778":"There is not a great degree of animals not even any elephants.","779":"Even in June most at were inside or hidden from the cold.","780":"Very expensive so see so few animals.","781":"Food expensive which is what you expect in tourists locations.","782":"\u00a316 for one small piece of fish and a tub of chips.","783":"I would not bother unless you are desperate.","784":"Recently visited with an additional needs group who enjoyed their day despite several exhibits closed and a few animals either ticked away in their accommodation of hidden by overgrown environment.","785":"The lion in particular was no where to be seen.","786":"The most frustrating aspect of the visit was the food offerings.","787":"The choice for a typical family was poor with an emphasis on vegetarian and vegan.","788":"Not of burger of pizza in sight.","789":"Food prices circa \u00a319 for a main course.","790":"Setting aside the cost and choice it\u2019s now all card payment which hardly \u201cinclusive\u201d and useless for those with additional needs and the elderly who often do not either have cards or wish to pay cash.","791":"You cannot even buy an ice cream with cash.","792":"Cash is legal tender and the museum needs to waken up to offering this as an option if it really wants to be part of an inclusive society.","793":"Overall the experience was fair but it\u2019s a costly family day out and if you want to go on a budget and eat what kids want to eat take a picnic.","794":"Recently visited the zoo with a group of young adults with additional needs.","795":"While they enjoyed their day out in favourable weather several sections of the zoo were cordoned off for upgrade and several of the key animals could not be seen due to heavy undergrowth such as the lion.","796":"The greatest draw back for our group and something that may be restrictive for others was the inability to pay cash for food and snacks, which in themselves were not best value.","797":"Having discussed the cash only policy with Ben the manager of the only resturant open, it would appear that a large American company by the name of Compass own and operate all of the food outlets and it\u2019s their policy to only accept card payments due to cash handling costs.","798":"The problem is that many visitors with additional needs and indeed many elderly visitors do not have digital payment options.","799":"I was advised that the zoo itself has no say in this and was advised to write to Her Royal Highness Princes Royal who is patron.","800":"Providing a cashless operation is unacceptable from a customer service perspective and generates a divisive and restrictive environment which is far from the \u201cinclusive\u201d society we are supposed to be living in.","801":"I would recommend that the only way to challenge this is with your feet and bring your own food with you which will both represent far better value and save much time queuing and serve as an indicator to Edinburgh Zoo that they must provide greater flexibility and inclusion for all.","802":"Very large zoo but few animals visible.","803":"there are better... obviously after Beauval it's hard to find better... plus it's all a steep hill that you have to climb... for me it's","804":"okay","805":"but with children it's quite hard.. .life-size dinosaurs can be seen as well as life-size Lego animals.","806":"afterward otherwise it's not great.","807":"buy the ticket on the internet you will avoid the queue otherwise do something else because it's still a bit expensive!!","808":"(32 euros)","809":"I was told it was good, but I was disappointed...","810":"What a lovely day out Edinburgh Zoo is.","811":"The staff were amazing!","812":"They would stop to talk about the animals even when you never asked.","813":"They were so friendly and knowledgeable.","814":"The lady volunteer (sorry didn\u2019t catch her name) near the baboons was fantastic.","815":"Loads of animals and loads to do.","816":"Plenty of cafes (indoor and outdoor) outdoor picnic areas and play parks.","817":"You could easily spend all day here.","818":"The zoo is on a hill so this may be a problem for anyone with mobility issues.","819":"Lego creations were also brilliant.","820":"My son did wish there was somewhere to build some lego creations himself, unsure if there was any as we couldn\u2019t see any.","821":"Would definitely recommend.","822":"What\u2019s not to like about this place, last here 3yrs ago & so much has changed & been added it\u2019s great.","823":"More places to sit outside & inside, lego additions are brilliant (well done for the time these took).","824":"Would like to see more of the snack\/food shacks open with places to get a take away coffee & better cleaning of the toilets but overall a brill day out.","825":"Giraffes did it for us this year & even though the Sloths were asleep they looked very cool.","826":"Download kids pass to get money off here.","827":"We spent about 2 hours at the Zoo en route to Edinburgh for the day.","828":"Here is our review :)OVERALL:A lovely zoo in beauty settings, the animals seemed well cared for!","829":"It isn't an overly modern zoo and some parts are a bit dated but it was very enjoyable!ANIMALSThere were of course your common animals including giraffes, monkeys, penguins etc.","830":"We didn't see the lion nor tiger anywhere which was a bit gutting.","831":"The penguin enclosure is probably the best in the UK and, if you visit in May\/ June you will probably see lots of chicks!","832":"Shame about the pandas return to China as I think this was the usp of the zoo...","833":"they have koalas though!CONSThis isn't a zoo very suitable for buggies to be honest.","834":"Animals such as Zebra, Lion, Tiger, Giraffe are up a very steep hill.","835":"I managed to get in for free with my Colchester Zoo annual pass and my partner got a company discount so it was affordable for us","836":"but I think the zoo is quite expensive in comparision to others I've been too.","837":"We visited as a family.","838":"Two children did a junior zookeeper experience and one adult did a penguin magic moment.","839":"Both experiences were fantastic.","840":"The zoo was easy to navigate and had accessible options like a Motability van to take wheelchair users to the top of the hill.","841":"Definitely value for money, we would recommend !","842":"Not the best of Zoos...everything is uphill and i think we saw more lego animals than real ones...although the penquin area was very good...dont think we will be returning to this zoo...","843":"This was a few years ago but this place was basically an excessively farm.","844":"Paid extra to see the world famous Pandas only to be told once we were in the Panda area that they do in fact sleep 23 hours a day so all the best spotting one.","845":"There was also a lion that just growled from a bush......nobody saw the fella all-day","846":"Had a great day out at the zoo with my daughter, niece (12) and grandson (2).","847":"We all loved seeing the animals and the viewing platforms meant we could get closer to them.","848":"3 Play parks in different areas of the zoo allowed the kids too run around.","849":"As mentioned in previous reviews the zoo is built on a hill which is quite steep at the very top part.","850":"We used the mobility vans which will take anyone with mobility issues and their party to whatever part of the zoo they want to go to.","851":"Staff were all very pleasant and eager to help visitors get the most out of their visit.","852":"As a side note Lego fans will love the animal Lego figures throughout the zoo.","853":"The zoo itself was fab but stay away from the Gannet restaurant, we ordered fish chips for 2 and a child's chicken goujons, the fish was straight from farm foods and the chips were absolutely disgusting the smell was horrible and the taste was oil, to me it was as if the oil they were cooked in needed replaced, I felt sick the rest of the day my husband and granddaughter left there chips to.","854":"I did make a complaint to the staff who agreed with me that they didn't look appetising but nothing was done didn't offer any refund or free ice cream nothing.","855":"The total cost of this disgusting meal was \u00a348, never again will I return to this place and I will be telling friends and family to stay away to.","856":"The zoo top marks and restaurant 1.","857":"Last minute decision to visit the zoo, we were a bit nervous about the hills as my mum has mobility issues but when we arrived we found that you can hire a mobility scooter for the length of your visit for a returnable deposit.","858":"This made our trip so much better as we were able to access almost all the areas of the zoo and weren't really restricted.","859":"Met a few volunteers who were incredibly helpful and shared lots of information about the animals which was nice.","860":"Despite the little bit of rain we had a thoroughly enjoyable day, the penguins and giraffes were my favourite.","861":"We visited the zoo on a weekend trip from Ireland.","862":"We booked our 8 year old daughter in for the meerkat keeper experience.","863":"The keeper whose name was Charlie was excellent.","864":"So much so that we now have a meerkat teddy called Charlie!!","865":"The rest of the trip around the zoo was nice.","866":"I\u2019d knock the point off because some enclosures had no animals due to maintenance.","867":"Overall well worth the trip.","868":"Brilliant selection of animals, most of them were out and playing.","869":"Clean complex with plenty to see and do.","870":"The ice cream was great.","871":"Would definitely visit again.","872":"One of the best Zoo's I've visited.","873":"Absolutely loved the zoo, visiting from Cambridgeshire and so glad we decided to chose the zoo to visit.","874":"Everywhere was clean, the zoo is well laid out with lovely habitats for the animals.","875":"A great and fascinating collection of animals.","876":"I love the greenery and other nature in this zoo, it makes it interesting to also show the children other things.","877":"Everyone was friendly, the food was nice and reasonably priced (to be expected for a zoo)","878":"There were lots of bins and benches to stop and have a break.","879":"Oh Edinburgh ZooYou are amazing ,just love love coming here ,it's such a lovely old zoo ,I never want to leave ,lots of different animals,they all look happy ,fantastic views if you can make it up to the top,yes it is a very very steep hill ,I hear people moan a lot about the food places ,if your not happy take your own packed lunch,that's what we do ,it's not hard to throw a few butties in a bag ,we come all the way from Warrington ,it's worth it !","880":"Always sad to leave \ud83d\ude22","881":"We will be back very soon","882":"Whilst it says on the website that the hill is set on sloping parkland it does not state that the hill goes straight up and doesn't zig-zag which would be normal when hills are involved.","883":"I am on a mobility scooter, so we took advantage of the accessible minibus to get to the top of the zoo.","884":"We saw the giraffes but the we found the hill was so steep that my scooter was trying to gather its own momentum and runaway.","885":"After a short distance my friend","886":"and I decided that this was not practical so sat on a bench and tried to phone the accessibility number only to find it was switched off!We sat for some time watching parents with buggies running past saying they could not stop as hill too steep.","887":"Eventually another member of staff came to feed the horses so she used her \"walkie talkie\" to arrange for the minibus to come and pick us up.","888":"We asked to be taken to the main entrance and left which was a shame as we had obviously paid the entrance fee.","889":"This zoo is not suitable for people with mobility problems and I would also suggest parents with buggies.","890":"Wow what a day, the penguins and otters didn't disapppoint both playing up for the cameras and their audience, little messers \ud83d\ude02.....the lions roar was soooo loud and the monkeys sounded like they were having a right giggle amongst themselves!","891":"The whole experience in the 3 hours we were there was brilliant, with all of the animals out and about and ready to put on a show!","892":"Highly recommend a visit","893":"I felt a little disappointed with the zoo maybe its because I am so used to Dublin zoo being so open and easy to get around but edinburgh I found to be a bit higelty pigelty and the animals extremely inclosed which I know they have to be but its so hard to see them and the glass is so dark that I found you had to go right up to the glass with your face to look in and there were tractors and vans constantly driving around so jumping out of the way \ud83d\ude43 as I said maybe its because I'm used to Dublin where the animals are alot easier to see and the one way system is great .","894":"Just my opinion I didn't think it was worth nearly 30 pound a ticket","895":"Great family day out on recent trip to Edinburgh with family.","896":"Prices were reasonable animals seemed well cared for and happy.","897":"This was a fanatics day out for me and my partner.","898":"We enjoyed seeing the animals but was a little disappointed that they was advertised they had Asian panda","899":"but when we when to see them it turned out they be returned to the wild.","900":"The restaurant the Gannet we at in was over priced for the food we received with a limited menu.","901":"In the penguin cafe the staff member we delt with was hard to understand as he spoke quietly and it not very well advertised that it card only though out the zoo.","902":"Came here with my girlfriend who loved seeing the animals and how close you can get to some of them.","903":"Was a large range of different species to see so something for everyone","904":"Built on steep hill, not ideal for strollers, wheelchairs, bad knees, or those not used to climbing steep inclines.","905":"You constantly are climbing inclines labeled steep, steeper, and steepest.","906":"No clear directions on where animals were, map didn\u2019t help.","907":"We gave up after 3 hours and didn\u2019t see all the animals.","908":"Had planned a relaxing day, ended up doing the opposite","909":"After a long dialogue over mail (from Feb-Apr) about booking for the RZSS Joeys we ended up being very disappointed with Edinburgh Zoo.","910":"Due to an oversight on their behalf - admitted by their staff - and after several months of waiting time we will not be able to get a seat at the course.","911":"We ended up with a feeling of inequity.","912":"We had a fantastic day out at Edinburgh Zoo during the Easter holidays.","913":"The focus here is on conservation and education, with lots of fun included.","914":"The staff are universally friendly, helpful and a credit to the zoo, whatever their role.","915":"The animals are obviously well looked after and the keeper talks are a great way to find out about them and about the work of the zoo.","916":"It's clear that the keepers really care about the animals they look after and know them really well.","917":"Take a photo of the screen in the visitor centre when you arrive for the talk times.","918":"Yes, the zoo is on a fairly big hill, but there are wonderful animals to see along the way and lots of places to rest, and it provides the animals woth a varied environment.","919":"I have a bad knee and I managed fine with rests.","920":"The food options on site are good, especially the newly refurbished Gannet restaurant, but you are welcome to take your own food.","921":"Picnic areas are good and spread throughout the zoo.","922":"Play areas are located near the picnic areas for kids.","923":"Toilets are clean and there are plenty of them.","924":"It's great to see the ongoing redevelopment of old enclosures to give the animals more space and better enrichment.","925":"It's also great to see the environmentally friendly choices in the food and retail outlets backing up the conservation message.","926":"No single use plastic here!The gift shop has a great range of items and at a good range of prices.","927":"We arrived just after 10am and left at nearly 6pm.","928":"Great value for money!Crucially, that entrance fee, and all the money spent on site is put right back into looking after the animals and into worldwide conservation projects.","929":"Highly recommended.","930":"3 adults and a child trekked around, barely anywhere to get a drink, many sites in the zoo undergoing refurb, very few animals on view, no penquin parade and barely any staff around to ask anything, other than when at the gift shop as we were leaving- where I saw about a dozen staff!","931":"Very disappointing and expensive.","932":"A word on entry about what is not open\/ available would be helpful, and perhaps a reduced fee during off-season would make it more of a reasonable offer.","933":"I was embarrassed to have taken my visiting friend & his son there.","934":"the staff was very rude to me and the animals looked very sad and badly treated.","935":"The only good thing was the food but it was still pretty horrible.","936":"It is very hard to book and I don't recommend going to this zoo.","937":"The cues are very long and it is a horrid.","938":"Enjoyed a day out here on a recent trip to Edinburgh.","939":"There was a long queue for the entrance even though tickets were pre paid.","940":"Staff at the entrance were knowledgeable and friendly.","941":"Even though it was midweek during the easter holidays there didn't seem to be any talks about any of the animals or any displays like in other wildlife parks in the central belt.","942":"The zoo did seem to be going through a lot of maintenance - a lot of empty enclosures and not a huge variety of animals.","943":"The view at the view point was obstructed by high bushes.","944":"My 4 year old had no problems with any of the slopes and enjoyed the variety of parks and the dinosaurs.","945":"Its a shame the zoo feels a bit run down as it could have been an amazing trip.","946":"Writing this, I wondered if I'm biased, still seeing it as I did when my Uncle took me over 60 years ago but I don't think so.","947":"Sure, I recall the old enclosures and cages with despair","948":"but I contrast that with how it is now, the far better enclosures, the staff, so dedicated, approachable, friendly and informed, the facilities.","949":"the endless upgrades.","950":"Sure, that hill gets now flatter","951":"but there's help.","952":"I'd prefer that the animals were in their natural habitats but the good that flows from them being on show outweighs that, even were it practicable.","953":"Unfortunately we were disappointed with our trip to Edinbugh Zoo, we have been to a couple of other zoos in England and this was nothing in comparison.","954":"Firstly I must say it rained all day which won't have helped with our experience as most of the animals stayed inside however obviously the weather is out of our control as is the behaviour of the animals but those points aside, we seen a lot of empty enclosures and no interaction with any of the animals other than the keepers feeding the penguins.","955":"We found the enclosures appeared very small in comparison to other zoos, Yorkshire Wildlife Park is a perfect example and the behaviour of the animals demonstrates this as you see them behaving more of how they would in the wild.","956":"This will be our first and last visit to Edinburgh Zoo.","957":"My friends and I adored this zoo, the animals are fantastic and well cared for.","958":"Only small disadvantaged to this zoo is it is all on a hill!","959":"I unfortunately suffer with some serious foo issues and when I walk up hill or for too long, I am in a lot of pain, I was unaware about the hills beforehand, so I was suffering that didn\u2019t stop me from having a good time!I would just be aware that if you suffer from any issues with walking, this might not be the best place to you, however, the zoo are more than happy to provide you with help if you need it!","960":"The zoo is a great workout for those looking to get some exercise in over the school holidays when normal routines may be on hold!","961":"There are definitely some steep hills and long enjoyable routes to take so perfect for those who love walking, like Disney world I would say take the buggy even if you don\u2019t usually !","962":"We did about 13000 steps or so and that was with the top half of the zoo closed off for high winds","963":"so I imagine maybe more if we were able to get up there.","964":"The two changing areas I used were satisfactory for baby change.","965":"The animals we saw included meercats,flamingos,chimps,penguins,hippo,some very funny otters who were really active and giving a show, monkeys,sloths - really recommend these creatures one was active when we went in and really lovely to watch.","966":"There are lots of information about the animals available to those who want it.","967":"You can take a picture of the tv screen at reception for the talks of the day, we managed to catch the chimps and magic forest tiny trek, the girl giving the talk (didn\u2019t catch her name but has blue hair) was wonderful, managed to keep the kids and adults attention for the duration of the talk and was very patient staying after and answering any questions about the zoo or a specific animal, she gave my daughter lots of great tips on how to prepare if she wanted to work with animals, please recognise the good job she does manager :)As mentioned top half was closed due to someVery strong winds, we will go back again to see the big cats,kangaroos etc.","968":"We packed snacks to last us as there are plenty of picnic areas to eat at however we were joined unexpectedly last minute due to a childcare emergency so we ended up having to go into the grasslands restaurant to provide food for said child - two kids pizzas,two cokes and two coffee around \u00a330 odd pounds, the place was filthy the floor especially but the staff were friendly and seemed to be attempting to clean up the floor as we left","969":"but we did dine amongst squashed chips and trodden in pizza, they have toilets and baby change In here too.","970":"Kids said pizza and chips were good, coffe was decent enough but wouldn\u2019t go back, recommend packing your lunch\/snacks if you can.","971":"Remember if you are with a member you can get discount on food,gift shop and entry tickets also free parking.","972":"We arrived around 12 noon and got one of the last parking spaces, the spaces were extremely tight if you have anything over a small car, so get there for opening if you need a guaranteed space or take the bus :)","973":"Every staff member we came across was friendly,upbeat and helpful which is saying a lot working amongst a lot of loud school kids and people who don\u2019t follow rules such as please leave buggy here or please don\u2019t eat inside this enclosure.","974":"Gift shop is of course fun to look at, you can get a zookeeper notebook and pen set for \u00a33.50 a baby vest about \u00a39 water bottles ranging from \u00a37-\u00a319 and sweet bags about \u00a33.75 they had some honey and cool things for adult on sale too.","975":"Top tips, get there early if by car, dress for Scottish weather remember you will be up a massive hill","976":"so it gets colder- definitely trainers or walking boots no heels or dress shoes you will get muddy!","977":"Pack your own food, be polite to the workers and try and catch some of the talks.","978":"Take a picture of the map on your phone.","979":"We visited the zoo with two kids (aged 5&2).","980":"It poured down all day, however it did not spoil the fun!We hired a two seater stroller as imagined the five your old would have some reservations walking up the hill in the rain, it cost \u00a36 (plus \u00a315 returnable deposit) and proved to be a valuable investment, and a great work out for us grown ups!In many ways the rain added to the experience as all the African animals opted to stay indoors, looking through the glass at us wondering why we were out in the rain!","981":"Meaning we had some great close ups with the big cats.","982":"We ate in the zoo, we appreciated the lack of plastic in take out containers\/ drinks etc!","983":"Nice to see a company making sound environmental choices.","984":"Special mention to the staff we interacted with, all were fantastic!","985":"We met Lucy at the giraffe enclosure who shared some great knowledge.","986":"The staff, who had spent as long in the rain as we had, still managed to be enthusiastic about the zoo and the animals.","987":"One member of staff helped us manner the stroller into the Rhino enclosure, nothing seems to much of an ask, everyone was great \ud83d\ude0a","988":"Most animals asleep and far away.","989":"My 3yr old loves animals but got bored very quickly.","990":"We would have left only for the price that we paid.","991":"Very expensive for what we got.","992":"Dublin zoo better, and that's saying something.","993":"Best animals were the pelicans and meerkat, and they were are the 1st animals that you see.","994":"Great day out with the kids and plenary steps in for exercise, food from Ro\u2019st was lovely and very friendly man serving, highly recommend.","995":"Great zoo and lovely staff.","996":"Great zoo and great staff.","997":"Be aware that everything is on a hill and that can be a challenge.","998":"Take plenty of breaks and breathers along the way.","999":"The zoo also offers free mobility vehicle service which is helpful.","1000":"Visited this morning for a \u2018Sunrise Safari\u2019 with my two year old.","1001":"The weather was definitely on our side thankfully which makes a huge difference when visiting Edinburgh Zoo (highly advise visiting in dry weather)Maurice our tour guide was fantastic, he really made the whole experience informative, funny and enjoyable and is a credit to the zoo with his in-depth knowledge combined with witty banter.","1002":"A private tour before the gates open to the public, deffo a great way to experience the zoo and would recommend booking one of these.","1003":"Since it was such a lovely day we took an additional two hours to wander around and there was plenty to see!","1004":"Definitely worth spending a lot of time there and really taking it in.","1005":"Lots to see and do for kids of all ages and adult animal enthusiasts alike.","1006":"First time visiting in 15 years and generally not a fan of zoos but really enjoyed our day and will be back soon on another sunny day.","1007":"Thanks Maurice!","1008":"We had a fantastic day at the zoo.","1009":"Great to see animals we haven\u2019t seen before, and all being looked after so well.","1010":"Do remember to wear sturdy shoes as some of it is a bit of a hike up steep hills, but well worth it for the amazing views.","1011":"Fabulous childhood memories from 1970 onwards.","1012":"First visit for 30 years.","1013":"Lots of changes, new exhibits , view points.","1014":"ButStill as hilly as ever!So be prepared, comfy shoes a must.","1015":"Tip One: start at the top and work your way down!Great to see the Giraffes back at the Zoo!","1016":"Would have expected a larger paddock given the space that the 3 Zebras have.","1017":"But that\u2019s just my opinion.","1018":"Tip Two: if you can carry, take your own food!","1019":"Remember the more you take the more you carry but the more you eat the less it weighs!","1020":"Also it\u2019s \u00a32.40 for a can of juice!Loved Penguin Rocks (memories of the Penguin Parade), Sun Bear (old Polar Bear exhibit), Living  Links, Budongo Trail ( remember the old ape house with the Orang who had his own portable black and white tv), koala exhibit, sadly too late for the Pandas.","1021":"The great lion and tiger exhibits, way better than the tiny exhibits of old.","1022":"Sadly the pacing back and forth of these magnificent creatures, I found to be upsetting).Good thing about a visit at this time of year is the lack of crowds and screaming children.","1023":"Felt like I had the place to myself which was great.","1024":"Weather wasn\u2019t too good which meant that a lot of animals were indoors.","1025":"But in warmer weather it gets busier, more unruly children although more animals are active!Loved seeing older enclosure remnants that I remember like prairie dog next to the pigmy hippo, the old monkey house, cat cages where tigers and lions used to be, rock hopper, the baboon rock,  etc.","1026":"Sadly the Ibis and Rhino enclosures have seen better days and don\u2019t look like they have changed much since I was a child.","1027":"More space needed for them (if I have a lottery win then I\u2019ll finance them)So many fond memories.","1028":"Bring back the Polar Bears, Sea LionsI had a great time.","1029":"Spent 6 hours and worth every penny.","1030":"Won\u2019t be 30 years for my next visit.","1031":"Good Zoo Shop, lots for kids but lacking in adult stuff.","1032":"Books about the history of the zoo would be a big seller (well I\u2019d buy one).I\u2019m off to find a picture of me about 8, sitting on a horse in the Farm area.","1033":"Oh lastly, I\u2019m gonna start a petition for you to bring Takins to the Zoo!","1034":"They would be perfect for the Panda area that\u2019s lying empty!","1035":"Awesome creatures!P. S. Was hoping to see the Japanese Macaques, great exhibit","1036":"but I guess they were still off show but didn\u2019t see anything to tell me that and no keepers nearby to ask.","1037":"Was hoping to see Honshu and his friendsNext time","1038":"I had a wonderful time at the zoo.","1039":"I highly recommend attending the talks, I learned lots of cool things about warty pigs and sloths from Jamie, who is a very pleasant and knowledgeable man","1040":"Edinburgh Zoo has a large range of animals which are all unique and very interesting to look at and learn about.","1041":"There are many food and drink options in sit in and take away cafes.","1042":"The atmosphere in the zoo is quite amazing as there are many plants.","1043":"Sadly like all zoos sometimes you don't see many animals as they are all sheltering from the Scottish weather.","1044":"Overall an amazing place to spend the day and definitely worth the money.","1045":"Greeted by friendly great Staff & warned about the hillIt was good at first when we saw the flamingos.","1046":"I just feel it needs better sign posting","1047":"yes I had a map","1048":"but with a buggy it\u2019s not always the bestI got around by asking the very nice staffFood - app did not work, time is of the essence with a child , pizza was burnt and the kids battered chicken was just not an option for my child to eat.","1049":"Again the staff were so very nice.","1050":"The hill was ridiculous pushing a buggy up hill pregnant should come with a better warning.","1051":"I never would  not have gone if I had know how steep the hill is on my own.","1052":"Shame really","1053":"We visited the zoo for the first time for my (adult) son's birthday treat.","1054":"He has learning disabilities and we always really appreciate the effort organisations go to with regard to accessibility when we visit attractions.","1055":"I booked online, a concession ticket for him and I was given free admission as his carer (he has an Access card with +1 on it).","1056":"We arrived as the zoo opened at 10am; Blue Badge parking was clearly signed and gave easy access to the zoo, there were also plenty of spaces that early in the day.","1057":"The lady at the admissions desk was lovely, checked we knew it was all uphill with some very steep slopes and showed us the accessible transport number on the back of the map so that we could call for a lift if we ran out of steam!","1058":"We did manage it","1059":"but it was nice to know we could get rescued if need be.","1060":"The weather was amazing, couldn't have been more perfect and the views out across the city to the hills beyond are breath taking.","1061":"The map is easy to follow and there are plenty of places to rest, picnic, use the toilet and buy food and drink if you need to.","1062":"Lots of information boards as well and all the staff we spoke to were lovely.","1063":"The animals were incredible, very active in the morning and we were lucky enough to get a good view of all of them.","1064":"It was a perfect day.","1065":"The gift shop was reasonably priced so my son enjoyed himself in there as well and when I caused a chaos at the end of the day by losing my ticket for the carpark the staff were lovely and sorted everything out very quickly.","1066":"It was a perfect day; we were very lucky with the weather and such good views of all the animals.","1067":"Given that it was a week day during term time it was relatively quiet which suits us as well.","1068":"We're looking forward to another visit soon.","1069":"*My visit was in October but owing to family illness I am only just getting around to reviewing my trip to Edinburgh now*I visited Edinburgh Zoo twice during my trip to the city.","1070":"The first was a full day and the second was to kill a few hours before my train home.","1071":"Both times I enjoyed my visit.","1072":"I was thrilled to see Yang Guang and Tian Tian before they left.","1073":"It was something that has been on my bucket list for years after watching them on the webcam for years, and I got to see them by the end of both visits.","1074":"A common theme I found around the zoo was all of the animals were clearly well loved and cared for.","1075":"The only thing I would say is the windows in the chimp house were filthy so it was hard to get photos and see them at times.","1076":"I also struggled to find the lion and giant anteater enclosures but got there in the end.","1077":"The staff were all very friendly and helpful.","1078":"The food was nice and good service.","1079":"I will definitely return someday.","1080":"Loved visiting this zoo as I am a member of Chester Zoo so took advantage of being able to visit here with my membership and I wasn\u2019t disappointed.","1081":"Beautiful scenery and the animals were totally different to those at Chester zoo .","1082":"I saw for the first time white pelicans, Pygmy hippo , armadillo, even the monkeys were different types to those at Chester .","1083":"The big cats were all out in the sunshine today , lions , tigers and a Scottish wildcat - another animal I had not seen before .","1084":"A very enjoyable day - be aware it is very hilly , however if you take your time , it is well worth the views from the top of the hill .","1085":"I had read on another review to do the hill first then work you way down and that was indeed very good advice and my add on would be to take a drink with you as due to the season there wasn\u2019t anywhere near the top to get one as they were shut as it\u2019s not busy season .","1086":"We spent 6 hours here and thoroughly enjoyed it and got a bus from Edinburgh old town which are every 15mins which dropped us off right outside.","1087":"I\u2019m not a huge fan of zoos.","1088":"I do however accept they serve a great purpose ( conservation ) so not totally adverse to visiting and Edinburgh have hippos ( ok pygmies but hippos all the same ) and I totally love hippos so whilst in Edinburgh, we wentWe were warned about the steepness before we went and again on arrival but the two of us in early 60\u2019s didn\u2019t have a problem , although I\u2019d not be wanting to push a wheelchair or buggyIt\u2019s a small city zoo but it\u2019s thoughtfully laid out","1089":"and I imagine that in the summer it is very pretty.","1090":"Yes in March it did look a bit bleak in areas but it\u2019s","1091":"MarchThe animal enclosures seemed to the untrained eye to be thoughtful, we spent a lot of time watching the chimps , their enclosure looked to be very well equipped and enrichedThe young keeper in the sloth house was just brilliant.","1092":"Very knowledgeable and enthusiastic and chatted away to us and interacted well with the young children visitingWe did get to see most of the animals , some were not visible but they are animals not trained pets and don\u2019t put on showsI did get to see at least one of my favourites, the breed I had travelled to see so I was happy enough with my visitA HUGE thankyou to the lass in the gift shop , Sonia??","1093":"I\u2019m sorry","1094":"I\u2019m rubbish at names but when I said I had travelled a long distance to see the hippos and the one and only was sleeping , she took my email and has sent me photos   That really did make my day.","1095":"To be fair all the staff we interacted with were all very helpful and friendlyIt\u2019s not a cheap day out but the money is well spent towards conservation.","1096":"We only have the privilege of seeing these animals because of zoos","1097":"Edinburgh zoo is absolutely amazing zoo and I really liked chimps ( they are my favourite animals ) and I think the enclosure is great","1098":"Had a great day at Edinburgh zoo.","1099":"There was no queue.","1100":"Enjoyed seeing the lions, tiger, rhino, giraffes, penguins and got very near a friendly sloth.","1101":"Please note there is alot of refurbishment going on.","1102":"Also a few empty enclosures.","1103":"In my opinion I would love to see a polar bear replace the pandas.","1104":"The views at the top of the hill is worth it.","1105":"We well return.","1106":"A very boring and run down zoo.","1107":"We\u2019ve visited plenty of zoo\u2019s, and this is by far one of the worst ones we\u2019ve seen.","1108":"The exhibits are boring, grounds are dirty, and the majority of refreshment shops were closed\u2026 a pre warning would\u2019ve been nice.","1109":"Costing over \u00a340 for the pair of us, we wished we\u2019d spent our money elsewhere.","1110":"Ps, bring some welly\u2019s if you do decide to waste your money, the place is caked in mud.","1111":"Don\u2019t waste your moneyNearly \u00a380 for 2 adults and a childThere was nothing thereHalf a dozen flamingos a few penquinsA rhino1 poor  stir crazy tiger with no water in its poolRocking back and forthFilthy conditions the poor things inEverything saying refurbishment going onWould not recommend","1112":"I\u2019ve visited plenty of zoos and wildlife parks in the past and this is by far the most disappointing experience I\u2019ve ever had whilst visiting one.","1113":"It started well, the staff were friendly and helpful\u2026just outside the entrance are the meerkats, pelicans, yep, all good so far,  just opposite there\u2019s an empty enclosure, then another and then another and so it goes on, There\u2019s just too many empty enclosures where animals have been in the past and when you eventually find one it\u2019s usually just the one looking all depressed.","1114":"Our group of 4 actually started feeling bad for them because of how they presented.","1115":"I\u2019ve already read that some of the animals are inside due to weather and I\u2019d accept that if that was the case but there\u2019s signs up stating empty, there\u2019s boarded up enclosures with spy holes with a wooden shaped animal behind them.","1116":"We left feeling like we\u2019d seen very little and robbed of \u00a3100.","1117":"I\u2019d never recommend this zoo to anyone and would not return.","1118":"Edinburgh has great people and  amazing history and attractions and we visited lots of them, this is not one of those attractions.","1119":"The place was great, it was funny.","1120":"But some animals were not here.","1121":"It is easily accessible.","1122":"It was not too busy on a Sunday.","1123":"if it wasn't for the penguins I would only have given two stars.","1124":"just so many animals were unavailable.","1125":"There were just to many empty pens and if there was something to see it was usually to far away.","1126":"I have to say, the hill is a sore walk,  I do have movement disabilities and the hill took it out of me.","1127":"Be aware.","1128":"I suppose I would go back for another visit but would do it in the summer months.","1129":"Brought our daughter here on her second birthday and she had a great time.","1130":"She\u2019s animal daft so was in her element, she particularly enjoyed the monkeys and koalas.","1131":"Edinburgh Zoo is always a a great day out.","1132":"We were there for about four hours before our daughter became too tired but you could easily spend an entire day there with the huge number of animals and enclosures to explore, and the demonstrations to attend.","1133":"With that in mind I believe the ticket prices are fair.","1134":"With regards to the food, we had coffee and cake on arrival at the Gannet Fish Bar which was very nice.","1135":"We then went to the Penguin Cafe for lunch which was, disappointingly, a bit hit and miss.","1136":"My panini was nice enough, and the children\u2019s lunch box was good, however my husband had the driest looking bacon roll I\u2019ve ever seen, and we were forced to sit at a dirty table which no one came over to clean the entire time we were there.","1137":"It was also quite expensive for what you got.","1138":"The staff we came across were all very pleasant, particularly the girl in the gift shop at the end who gave our sleepy and rather grumpy daughter a pack of animal cards.","1139":"All in all a great day out, will definitely be back.","1140":"Definitely the highlight for my birthday.","1141":"The two sloths they have at the zoo are cute as heck!","1142":"This time of year .aye not be the best time but still made for a lovely evening walking around, getting to see some nice wee animals and get your steps in!","1143":"I left here feeling very confused.","1144":"I completely understand, regretably, the need for zoos and conservation.","1145":"I actually only went to see the Giant Panda but after walking up to the top was greated with a sign advising that they had gone home.","1146":"Some of the animals seem content with more space than others while others seem lethargic and uninterested.","1147":"Wonderful zoo.","1148":"Too large area , at least three hours need to see all animals..","1149":"Penguins are much more fun.. you can pay additional to feed penguins","1150":"Edinburgh zoo is a bit meh, there wasn't much to do in the zoo but see a penguin maybe it was dead or maybe it wasn't?  and there was only so many places to get a bite to eat to be honest i didn't think Edinburgh  zoo was all that big to be honest and if you have mobility problems ascending up hill to see the animals up there can be quite difficult.","1151":"there maybe transport to get up to the top of hill","1152":"but we didn't ask.","1153":"there is a shop here that sells various souviners and the like and it on the bus route look for the buses with the animals on the side of the buses and that's the buses that take you to the zoo.","1154":"Its on hill, only those people should visit who can walk uphill\/ downhill.","1155":"As regards zoo experience, its different and good.","1156":"Penguin, tiger, rhino, giraffe etc.","1157":"If you are in Edinburgh and have time then you may consider visiting.","1158":"on the contrary, Vienna zoo is better.","1159":"Fun trip to the zoo great members of staff it\u2019s a shame the pandas are away as that new enclosure was really nice will be interesting to see what animals replace them in the new enclosure this year as well as the old one at the back of the penguin enclosure.","1160":"Some great new enclosures such as giraffes hopefully baby giraffes in the future.","1161":"Some enclosures could do with modernising with the money saved from the pandas would be nice to see some updates happen as we have not really had one since the new giraffe enclosure back in 2021.","1162":"I remember there was the zoos big 5 campaign which included the giraffes, you guys put on which suggested some great ideas like a tropical house with crocodilians etc hopefully this and other new ideas like this will come back now that the zoos in hopefully a healthier position going forward.","1163":"Lovely and smaller zoo (2 hrs) with animals I have never seen before (panda for example).","1164":"You can see animals from everywhere!","1165":"Nice and clean :)","1166":"Amazing dinosaurs on the top of the hill :)","1167":"In April there was not nearly anyone so we enjoyed it a lot :)","1168":"We booked the Junior Zoo keeper experience for our eleven year old grandaughter and it totally exceeded our expectations.","1169":"The communication before the event was excellent with lots of information about what to exepct well in advance.","1170":"The week of the visit she was told what specific animals she would be involved with on the day.","1171":"We were warmly greeted by Cheryl Ann who is an experienced member of the team.","1172":"Everything was explained again as our grandaughter got changed into her wellies.","1173":"The next three hours just flew past as she shadowed Cheryl Ann into the penguins, the Red Pandas, the Sloths, Meerkats, Cuscus and Armadillos.","1174":"Amazing all round with lots of informaiton shared as we walked around the zoo from enclosure, to bamboo store, to another enclosure.","1175":"Although it is fairly expensive, it is good value as it is a once in a lifetme chance to be up close and personal for a full afternoon, with some wonderful animals - some of whom (Red Pandas) are on the endangered list to even more special.","1176":"Special memories were made on that day for sure.","1177":"Thank you Cheryl Ann and thank you Edinburgh Zoo!","1178":"Attended yesterday for a Junior Zoo Keeper experience with my son.","1179":"We both had an amazing day, especially my son.","1180":"He hasn\u2019t stopped talking about it.","1181":"James, our guide was very welcoming, friendly and very informative.","1182":"My son got to feed\/see a number of different animals, nothing felt rushed and we were able to ask so many questions.","1183":"Highly recommend and it\u2019s something we\u2019d do again in the future.","1184":"My son also received a t-shirt and a certificate.","1185":"Our favourite animals are now hairy armadillos :)","1186":"Medium-sized zoo but poorly organized and in some cases even poorly maintained.","1187":"It's a shame we couldn't observe the panda for reasons unknown to us.","1188":"Went just for the pandas before they leave as my child loves them.","1189":"Car parking available for the small price of \u00a33 all day payable with a ticket at the visitor receptionQueue to get into reception but moved quicklyStaff friendly and efficient at processing pre bought ticketsBit of an uphill hike to get to things like the tigers but definately worth itMobility aids available for hire at reception for those with limited mobility and also sensory packs for children with additional needs, as a parent of a sen child the option of this alone gives a 5* rating.","1190":"I was here with several friends to see the zoo.","1191":"Animals seemed happy and the enclosures were very nice.","1192":"I was glad to see a place giving Asiatic Lions some recognition, as they are a brilliant subspecies.","1193":"The only concern I may have had is the rather concerning coprophagy displayed by the Chimps.","1194":"I do not if this is normal behavior","1195":"but it wasn't very pleasant to witness.","1196":"Other than that debauched sight, this was a brilliant zoo, and the environment enrichment was very good, and the animals seemed in the main very content.","1197":"i am a teenager and i do live close to edinburgh, so i am not a tourist.","1198":"i have had my fair share of class and family trips to the zoo and here is my honest opinion.","1199":"honestly the zoos quite cool, the penguins are the most entertaining animal i will say.","1200":"i was sad to hear that the pandas are leaving but im really glad theyre going back home.","1201":"all the workers at the zoo are really nice and the gift shop actually has good things in it which is a rare sight to see.","1202":"i will say it is a lot of walking but thats understandable but just to make sure youre prepared and in comfy shoes and that.","1203":"Good zoo plenty of animals staff nice based on a hill so wouldn\u2019t advise if you have mobility issues.","1204":"The cafe was full of staff but no one made eye contact with you just walked by when waiting for a table so improved required there","1205":"We travelled to Edinburgh for a pre booked Christmas breakaway, The Zoo was always on the list to do in the short few days we were there, We missed seeing the Pandas by a week but non the less really enjoyed the day out.","1206":"The weather was dreary and wet and let's be honest everything seems a bit better in life when it's warm and sunny but still you make the most of it and we did just that, Credit to all the volunteers that are on hand to help out, very informative and had a good chat about the giraffe and conservation activities taking place which is important as you know money spent goes to these types of projects, it's a mammoth task feeding all the animals and their welfare , keeping places heated and running facilities for people to enjoy and access.","1207":"Zoos will always split opinions as some feel it's cruel, that they feel the animals don't look happy etc","1208":"and I appreciate it's nice to see animals in their own natural habitats but what we all have to understand times have changed and changing at an alarming rate","1209":"so it's important there's an intervention where possible and needed to help preserve species and let other generations seeing the wonder of world and all the amazing animals that we share the earth with, technology has evolved which enables professionals to gain a wider understanding so as I say it does split opinion but people who work with these animals have nothing but their best interest at heart and do the best they can with what they have to work with.","1210":"Special mention to a lady on the reception desk (think her name was Sally) really helpful, chatty and we were discussing places left in Europe where pandas could be seen, I knew of a place in Finland (Ahtari Zoo) which has 2 pandas on a 15 year stay, I believe they arrived in 2018 so ever that way might be worth a visit and Sally said Berlin was another place that still has a Panda.","1211":"Gift shop was great, couldn't find any merchandise with both yang guang and tian tian on together","1212":"so we made use of the custom design yourself machine and made a notebook and fridge magnet that paid homage to them together \ud83d\udc3c\ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udc3cI love all animals so can't really say I have a particular favourite however I think the meerkats are amazing, could sit and watch them all day, there was a rather funny young chimp that was great to see, there was a few that we missed or couldn't see but overall it was lovely day out.","1213":"As people have said its hilly, take your time, plan a route or you'll end up all over the show up n down but most importantly enjoy your day, think outside the box and ask questions about the conservation projects, about the animals because it's enlightening and interesting.","1214":"Happy Christmas to to one and all \ud83d\udc39\ud83e\udd81\ud83e\udd9d\ud83e\udd98\ud83d\udc05\ud83e\udd93\ud83e\udd9a\ud83d\udc3c\ud83c\udf3f\ud83d\udc3c\ud83c\udf85","1215":"We have been to Edinburgh many times but never got as far as the Zoo however with the soon to be Departing Pandas it was a must we brought our granddaughter to see these beautiful BearsBe prepared for plenty of exercise as it\u2019s built on a hill and the pandas are at the top but once you do get there wow even though they were sleeping it was amazing to see themThe rest of the zoo was also great with a penguin area to rival other zoos we have been toIt was a super day we loved it","1216":"What a great zoo!","1217":"But do be prepared for some good exercise as the zoo is located on the side of a hill.","1218":"We travelled to Edinburgh, for our first time, in order to wish the wonderful Giant Pandas; Yang Guang and Tian Tian, well before their journey back to China.","1219":"The zoo itself appears to be in a state of transition, with many new and updated environments littered amongst the older more traditional cages.","1220":"Walking the zoo can take a toll due to the hillside which it sits upon, but this did not deter our enthusiasm or enjoyment of the animals on display.","1221":"We particularly enjoyed the Spider Monkey exhibit!","1222":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo as part of my surprise 40th birthday.","1223":"The zoo was amazing, we got to see the pandas before they return to China during December.","1224":"We saw lots of other animals also; sloths, lion, tigers and the sun bear.","1225":"The zoo was very hilly and although this didn\u2019t stop us, it might be something others may have to consider when visiting.","1226":"We visited the penguin cafe when visiting all the penguins, had a hot drink and a cake each and we found the prices to be reasonable.","1227":"No more than you would pay in your local Costa or Starbucks.","1228":"I have wanted to see the pandas for a long time so to get to see them for my birthday before they leave the zoo was a dream come true.","1229":"Staff were welcoming and friendly - we pre-book our tickets but the queues didn\u2019t seem long at all.","1230":"The gift was great and wasn\u2019t too expensive - we brought quite a lot of stuff","1231":"but I just couldn\u2019t resist!We really enjoyed our time at the zoo - if we didn\u2019t live so far away we might visit more often!Thank you Edinburgh Zoo!","1232":"Spent a very enjoyable day at the Zoo,it was hilly but that didn't stop us seeing all the animals we wanted to see.","1233":"Highlights for us was seeing the Pandas of course, lion and giraffes!","1234":"We had a lovely trip to the Zoo.","1235":"My daughter (3 years) and I travelled up from the midlands by train to come and see the Panda\u2019s before they go home to China.","1236":"Reading the mixed reviews on here before going did worry me a bit","1237":"but we came anyway","1238":"and so glad we did.","1239":"We arrived just before 10 and joined a small queue and entered relatively quickly once open.","1240":"All staff were friendly.","1241":"Lady on the till said to scan QR code for the map but a paper would of been better (or offered if they were available).","1242":"Information with regards to different things closing earlier would be good (sloth house at 3, we didn\u2019t realise and missed it by 5 mins \u2639\ufe0f) or if there was signage, to be pointed out on entry.","1243":"Signage throughout the park could do with a bit more clarity and frequency.","1244":"They were the only niggles I had.","1245":"We were prepared for the big hill and even the rain wasn\u2019t going to stop us.","1246":"We went up twice and got very lucky second time round seeing both the panda\u2019s awake and chomping bamboo.","1247":"Hard work with a pushchair but we just took our time.","1248":"Kiddy lunch box in the penguin cafe was reasonable for zoo prices (6.50).","1249":"Taxi rank outside, which we took advantage of in the pouring rain.","1250":"I really enjoyed seeing the Koalas and Sun Bear too (hope she gets a new friend soon) and my daughter loved the Rhino.","1251":"Hope the Panda\u2019s arrive back safe and sound.","1252":"I came here with my son on Saturday 11th November and we had an amazing day in the gorgeous autumn sunshine.","1253":"We arrived at 10am and left at closing time 4pm and we still didn't see everything.","1254":"Our favourite animals were the penguins, Qabid the Rhino and we were so happy to get to say goodbye to the pandas.","1255":"Reasonably priced and easy to park.","1256":"We loved it.","1257":"Really special day out.","1258":"We had booked the 30 minute Meerkat Magic Moment experience, which was indeed magical!","1259":"James, our keeper, was super lovely and informative, and we loved being able to get right up close and feed the meerkats.","1260":"Also excellent value, because the experience voucher included zoo entry and carparking.","1261":"The rest of the zoo was also brilliant.","1262":"So many amazing animals, and we were fortunate to see many of them right up close (a quiet weekday in November turned out to be a good time to go).","1263":"All creatures appeared very well cared for, and there was a strong emphasis on animal welfare and conservation in all the info around the site.","1264":"Great keeper talk on the pandas, and we felt very privileged to be able to see them in the final days before they return to China.","1265":"Facilities were good.","1266":"We stopped at the Penguin Cafe for lunch, which had decent coffee and snacks.","1267":"Toilets were clean.","1268":"Great mobility vehicle service too: my mum is 79 and pretty fit but the whole zoo is on a very steep hill, so after the Meerkat experience we phoned the mobile number and were picked up within 10 minutes and transported from the bottom of the site to the top, so that we could start there and work our way back down.","1269":"This made the whole day much more manageable (and our driver was lovely and couldn't have been more helpful).Customer service generally was excellent from start to finish too.","1270":"I had a few phone calls  about the meerkat experience prior to our visit, and the booking and all questions afterwards were answered very helpfully and efficiently.","1271":"All zoo staff on the day were also really pleasant and helpful.","1272":"A wonderful day for us, highly recommended!","1273":"Not been to the zoo for years so was glad to get to see the pandas before they leave.","1274":"Beautiful animals.","1275":"Disappointed that the little train that takes you to top of Hill not there...so many people  struggling with prams.","1276":"I bought my disabled brother to the zoo in past and staff were amazing putting him on the transport I could never have pushed him uphill  Sunday.","1277":"Did not see  many animals out but then weather different to their natural habitat but overall enjoyed my visit","1278":"This zoo really is amazing for the animals that can be seen.","1279":"We was fortunate enough to plan our trip when the pandas where there and they are honestly amazing, such a shame they are going home.","1280":"There was koala bears, kangaroos and lots of animals that aren\u2019t in every typical zoo which is nice to see new animals!","1281":"The staff are all so friendly and nice which really makes the experience better speaking to them and hearing about the animals.","1282":"The only downside which people must consider is the hills.","1283":"This whole zoo is built on a very strong incline which can make it hard to visit every animal near the top of the hill.","1284":"Obviously this is not a fault of the actual zoo but something to bear in mind if mobility is a concern.","1285":"The good thing about this zoo is they limited the amount of glass separating animals and yourself (where possible).","1286":"For example the hippo enclosure was built so you go into their enclosure but they are a bit below with a gate separating.","1287":"This makes it more immersive","1288":"It rained most of the day, and we were still able to see every enclosure due to the indoor sections.","1289":"Learned a lot about the research that is carried out at the zoo, very interesting.","1290":"Be ready to walk up hill.","1291":"Enjoyed a recent visit to Edinburgh Zoo, all staff were friendly and helpful throughout.","1292":"A couple of things to be aware of, there are some very steep hills to reach all points of the zoo, the signposting of each section is not too easy to follow and could be clearer.","1293":"This certainly wasn't helped by no paper maps being available on entry to follow.","1294":"Very long queues on opening on the day we visited, not brilliant if the weather is unkind.","1295":"Still, well worth a visit, personal favourites were the penguins and giraffes, where you can get up close.","1296":"I fail to see how anyone could not see animals here, there are thousands.","1297":"The zoo is  a massive site  on a fairly steep hill but we managed with our double buggy and three small children.","1298":"It reminded me (except the weather ) of Taronga zoo.","1299":"The pandas were incredible but there are so many other wonderful animals to see.","1300":"We where there from the minute it opened, to when it closed and where entertained all day.","1301":"We had a really good lunch at a container outlet right at the top and ate amongst the dinosaurs.","1302":"I ve never seen such a huge penguin enclosure and the keeper talks where great that we saw.","1303":"I\u2019d rate it as one of the best zoos and I\u2019ve been to alot.","1304":"We will def come back if we come to Edinburgh again.","1305":"What a fantastic experience to visit the zoo on a superb environment for all the animals, plenty of thought went into the lay out for each animal.","1306":"We were lucky to see the Pandas before they return to China on 5th DecemberA great day out for any animal lover with good assistance from all the staff .. even giving people lifts to the top of the hills of the zoo","1307":"Really enjoyable couple of hours touring the zoo & especially liked all the pandas, giant & red, who we were lucky enough to see without any crowds around.","1308":"We had a fantastic experience at edinburgh zoo, as a zoo keeper.","1309":"Our zoo keeper Kayleigh was great, so welcoming and easy to get along with.","1310":"In addition to this, Kayleigh was extremely knowledgable about the zoo and the animals, it was a pleasure!","1311":"The experience itself was brilliant, I would strongly advise to do it.","1312":"Getting up close and personal with the animals, playing games and feeding them.","1313":"We got to see the sloths, penguins, rhino, meerkat and armadillo.","1314":"They were all very funny in their own way, words will not describe how fun the experience was, so please give it a go!!!","1315":"The primary reason for our visit was to see the giant pandas before they leave but there were so many other delightful animals to see including the sloths where one decided to climb across the rope above our heads, a Sumatran tiger who was chasing away some very cheeky magpies who kept trying to steal it's food and a gorgeous sun bear.","1316":"There was a really informative volunteer aswell by the red pandas.","1317":"We had some food and drink in the cafe.","1318":"We got there by catching the 26 bus from Edinburgh City Centre.","1319":"Please visit this lovely zoo and if you are ever in the West Midlands where we live please also visit Dudley Zoo which is a similar zoo to Edinburgh.","1320":"Fantastic day out.","1321":"So many animals!","1322":"Catching the giant pandas before they go topped off our visit.","1323":"We visited in Scottish half term.","1324":"Our 8 year old son loved it.","1325":"Dinosaurs topped it off for him.","1326":"Well what a place, if you fancy everest base camp fill youe boots.","1327":"Animals none existent, access to everyrhing shocking, pandas pointless( except zoo has no say on this).","1328":"Paths closed path like the eiger, nothing accept the pandas, utter waste of money.","1329":"Wife fell over staff couldnt care less utter waste of money.","1330":"All cafes closes.","1331":"Utter con","1332":"Arriving to the zoo by car was very easy and there were plenty of parking spaces.","1333":"There was a massive queue to get in (waited around 30 mins) which were due to some technical issues with payments.","1334":"We had prepaid our ticket and had to wait in the queue anyways.","1335":"The zoo is located on a massive hill which you will have to climb in order to see everything.","1336":"My advice to people would be to get a map and just get the hill climb over with and look at everything going down the hill.","1337":"If you have little ones you may want to rent out a buggy from them (we did)A lot of the food places were closed and so only had a choice 2 places which was a shame, the food (as expected) was quite expensive so it may be worth while just taking a packed lunch.","1338":"We got to see most of the animals we wanted to and had a very good time with location (hill) probably stopping me giving this 5 stars","1339":"Loved it enjoyed every minute not suitable for people with walking issues as very hilly even though they did have mini buses taking people who had walking issues to the top of the zoo to see the pandas.","1340":"The main purpose of the visit was to see the pandas before they go back to China, which we achieved!!","1341":"However the remainder of the park was disappointing to say the least.","1342":"I appreciate it is slightly out of season however to charge full price when a large percentage of the enclosures are empty, and those which do have animals are being cleaned in the middle of the day with animals moved out of sight until the cleaning is complete.","1343":"Surely this could be done once the park is closed??Also, all food outlets are closed minus one.","1344":"I think the above was the opinion of all the people whom we spoke to at the zoo.","1345":"A very expensive day to walk around a virtually empty zoo!","1346":"Fabulous day out.","1347":"We underestimated how long it would take us but this was not a problem for us as we'd put a day aside to visit.","1348":"The zoo itself was massive with so much to see.","1349":"The main attraction was definitely the pandas.","1350":"Personally I feel the panda enclosure should have been more heavily supervised as guests were pushing a shoving one another to get to the front as well as some guests standing at the front of the viewpoint for up 30 minutes at a time.","1351":"I would highly recommend guests bring snacks and drinks, especially off season, as only two of the food places were open and were extremely busy.","1352":"Pre-booking isn't necessary as you still need to que to get into the park regardless.","1353":"Also be aware that you need to pay for the carpark.","1354":"Overall a really good day out","1355":"but there is room for improvement.","1356":"The main reason we went was for the penguins but we also got to see animals we\u2019d never seen before like the giant pandas, kangaroos and an armadillo.","1357":"Also got a great close up experience with the chimpanzees!!","1358":"Day was made by the wonderful member of staff at reception who managed to track down a phone charger (my phone died 90 minutes in) and allowed me to charge my phone while we got refreshments and the kids played on the play area.","1359":"This meant that I could take more fantastic photos, get treats at the penguin cafe and spend a fortune on merchandise (cause I could transfer money via my banking ap).","1360":"Would highly recommended this place and I\u2019m leaving extremely happy with amazing memories and a Penguin Christmas jumper (plus a soft toy each for the kids, hand drawn art prints and a penguin tote bag!!).","1361":"Thanks for such a wonderful experience and we hope to be back!!","1362":"I told the kids myself during the October holidays to Edinburgh Zoo.","1363":"We took pubic transport from larbert, getting the train and then bus.","1364":"We booked the tickets online the day before.","1365":"It meant the queue was short.","1366":"We had an incredible day, we saw all the animals including the Panda.","1367":"We loved the red panda the most.","1368":"We took a packed lunch and then bought a few snacks.","1369":"The play parks were fab.","1370":"Thank you for a great time!","1371":"The zoo is a vast improvement on my visits there as a child.","1372":"I can see why David Attenborough says Edinburgh Zoo is an example of what all Zoos should be.","1373":"As a massive site, with a continuous program of repairing renewal, there are parts which are brand-new and others which are due for some TLC.","1374":"But overall the experience was excellent.","1375":"Catering left room for improvement although the staff were helpful and friendly.","1376":"Grasslands produced an excellent sharing.","1377":"Plant-based platter, but the interior is overdue for a bit of renovation.","1378":"Gannets looked much more inviting, but unfortunately the fish and chips were straight out the freezer and not the freshest.","1379":"Maybe the penguins get first choice.","1380":"And the banana flower was\u2026\u2026 interesting.","1381":"Overall, the zoo is not a cheap family day out, and it would be good if the food quality was up to the same standard as the Zoo in general.","1382":"Arrived at 10ish on a very wet day.","1383":"I had bought non refundable and non exchangeable tickets months ago for 4 adults and 2 children so not going wasn't an option unless we wanted to lose over \u00a3100.","1384":"We were seen quickly by a lovely member of staff who had us through in no time.","1385":"We also bought some raincoat covers for \u00a33.50 each which I thought was very pricey for essentially a plastic sheet, but we needed them so we bought them.","1386":"Be warned, this zoo is very steep in places so if you have any mobility issues, maybe see if there's any assistance they can offer to get to the top.","1387":"Expectations were low due to the weather but it was disappointing even without that.","1388":"We saw the back of a giant panda in its enclosure, but im realy glad I've seen them regardless.","1389":"Of course, the weather being as it was it wouldn't have been fair to expect the animals to be out, however I was surprised at how little you could see from the viewing sheds.","1390":"We ended up seeing about 10 species of animals.","1391":"The signage at the very top isn't great, so we missed the giraffes and the lion.","1392":"We followed the signs for the lion but then this turned into the Tiger Trail.","1393":"We ended up abandoning the day as we were all a bit fed up of climbing hills and dodging the rivers of water running down the paths.","1394":"There's not loads of info about the animals either compared to other zoos I've been to, just the odd basic info board.","1395":"Overall, I think when it's the summer months, this would probably have been an entirely different experience but with it being a wet and dreary day in October, opportunities for viewing were very limited.","1396":"I gave 2 stars because the opportunity to see the animals when they were inside wasn't great, a lot of the pens were empty and we seemed to walk for ages between seeing any animals.","1397":"Not the most enjoyable day with 3 teenagers and an 8 year old in tow who were disappointed not to see a bit more.","1398":"Went to see the giant pandas before they return to china, absolutely amazing.","1399":"Plenty of viewing spots for both of them.","1400":"Would recommend going up there a couple times since we went early and saw both but when we went again later in the day only saw one.","1401":"VERY steep, however they do have mobility services if need be.","1402":"Can\u2019t really get anywhere in a rush due to the steepness.","1403":"Must queue to get in whether you have tickets or not, but queue goes down very quickly.","1404":"Gift shop is very good, very reasonable prices and a range of items to match any price point.","1405":"A little bit of a maze to see every animal, so make sure to arrive early.","1406":"Some parts of the zoo close early, ask the zoo staff on way in about that.","1407":"We arrived at about 11:30, didn\u2019t leave until 10 minutes to closing and didn\u2019t see absolutely everything.","1408":"Over half of the enclosures were empty so alot of the animals we had wanted to see, we were unable to.","1409":"Considering the price this is rather disappointing to say the least.","1410":"Also most of the cafes were closed.","1411":"Probably wouldn't bother visiting again.","1412":"Although lots of people in a long queue at the entrance, the walkways, restaurant, and exhibits were not crowded.","1413":"Enjoyed the animals and information.","1414":"Playgrounds were a bonus.","1415":"Shout-out to employee Chris for bringing an ice pack to our family member who had fallen.","1416":"A lovely day!","1417":"We visited whilst holidaying in scotland we have not been before, the zoo is in the main centre bit of a strange setting, we booked online before arriving they do not give you an option to pre book parking which they should mean as you have to pay save doing it on arrival.","1418":"The zoo is very hilly not suitable for people with mobility issues, we struggled in places.","1419":"We went to see the pandas not realising they will be going in december unfortunately  we only saw one of them, the glass windows were cloudy which made viewing difficult, we didnt see the porcupine, or the armadillos as well as a few other animals as some pens were empty.","1420":"The Grasslands restaurant was closed so we went into the cafe near the penguin enclosure my son a d his g\/friend had paninis a can drink each and a bag of crisps which came to \u00a320  they said the paninis were cold inside, i had a meal deal ( sandwich,coffee and crisps) for \u00a38 i had to take the coffee back as it was barely warm cafe was busy and tables wefe full of rubbish.","1421":"We spent about 3hrs here which made it an expensive day 90 for 4 tickets \u00a340 on lunch and \u00a33 parking, i dont think it offers value for money.","1422":"A fairly large zoo located on a hill.","1423":"My overall impression from the visit is not good.","1424":"It is difficult to find your way around the zoo.","1425":"Many small winding paths that do not naturally guide you around the garden.","1426":"The toilets that I visited were cold, dirty and very small.","1427":"I am by no means overweight or wide.","1428":"Many of the enclosures seemed too small.","1429":"Especially with the rhinos.","1430":"Not much had been done to make the enclosures nice for the visitors or exciting for the animals - only with the monkeys.","1431":"Some of the animals were sleeping inside and generally seemed depressed.","1432":"No program around claims.","1433":"Should not be visited by people with reduced mobility.","1434":"Very steep climbs.","1435":"They could consider a small train around the park.","1436":"In general, parks seem run down and they could benefit from looking at other zoos in Europe maintaining their areas.","1437":"I actually don't have much nice to say about my visit.","1438":"We went up on the 12th for my wife\u2019s Birthday to see the Panda\u2019s before they leave the zoo.","1439":"They are incredible!","1440":"My wife and daughter, for a long time have watched them on the Panda Cam but they are a sight to see when you are standing in front of them.","1441":"The zoo is a little challenging for those who have mobility issues but the staff are so helpful with this, they will drive you to the top and if you need them again they will come and take you back up the hill.","1442":"A big thanks for a great day out and to all the staff.","1443":"I know the people who work there likely work very hard, but that place just is nowhere near enriching enough for the animals held there.","1444":"Every single animal you see is visibly stressed and\/or depressed.","1445":"There's hardly any natural enrichment for them, they merely exist.","1446":"The animals should be moved to a bigger more appropriate zoo and Edinburgh zoo closed down.","1447":"What a great place to visit, though you really need to be good at walking!","1448":"It's all uphill..","1449":"Great to see the panda, and the penguins were so funny.. all the animals were great and obviously well looked after.","1450":"You need a good few hours to get round.","1451":"Nice place, nice animals.","1452":"You have to walk quite a bit to see all the animals.","1453":"They are well cared for and have nice places where they are.","1454":"Near the city.","1455":"Ideal if you have a few hours left before arriving at the airport or for a long layover.","1456":"Honestly I was disappointed with the whole place it's looking tired having visited 10 years ago , we went because my partner wanted to see the panda's which was lovely apart from the panda talks at 12.30 never happened and apparently was then going to be held at 2.30??","1457":"I think some investment is needed maybe use some of the profit made from \u00a33.50 cans of soft drinks in the cafe","1458":"Great day out only a short bus ride from the city centre.","1459":"The animals are well displayed and the staff friendly and happy to chat about their charges.","1460":"The penguin pool is brilliant - don't miss the side part where you can watch the birds swimming underwater.","1461":"One caveat - the site is on a hillside so could be hard work if you are pushing a buggy or wheelchair","1462":"Decided on this Visit as I wanted to primarily see the Pandas before they go back to China but also the Koalas and Pygmy Hippo.","1463":"Also as a Chester Zoo member I get a free entry.","1464":"Arrived at the Zoo at about 11:30.","1465":"We decided on a taxi as wanted to get there ASAP to make the most of the visit.","1466":"Taxi about \u00a314 from the city centre and the driver gave us a card for booking a return journey which was also quick and easy.","1467":"Now onto the Zoo itself.","1468":"Yes it's very hilly","1469":"but we just took out time and stopped for a rest when needed.","1470":"Also the ticket staff advised us of this before we went in which is good to make people aware.","1471":"Lots of walking around with a total of 9000 steps.","1472":"Managed to see the male panda, Pygmy Hippo and Koalas amongst others.","1473":"The tigers were in hiding but tbh I've found that in other Zoos too.","1474":"Missed the lions as the signage isn't always clear.","1475":"Due to it being out of season a lot of the food stands were closed up now for winter but that didn't make much difference.","1476":"We found that we had to go back to the Panda and Hippo again as they were sleeping","1477":"but hey that's animals for you","1478":"but it was worth seeing them especially as we don't often get pandas over here.","1479":"The gift shop has a good variety of things to buy.","1480":"The staff all seemed pleasant on interaction too.","1481":"We travelled from Cornwall to Edinburgh to see the panda bears (which we did).","1482":"The zoo is quite large, and all of the habitats look well maintained.","1483":"Reasonable prices in the gift shop (for a gift shop!)","1484":"Staff were all friendly.","1485":"Would definitely love to visit again, maybe with better weather!","1486":"Loved the wet floor signs, and I'm definitely ordering them for my workplace!","1487":"Fabulous zoo!","1488":"Saw the giant pandas again.","1489":"The zoo is very hilly so be warned!Staff all friendly and knowledgeable and care about the animals.","1490":"If I didn't live so far away, I'd be visiting very often","1491":"A visit to see the Pandas was some what disappointing Edingburgh zoo is situated on a steep hill and not recommended for people with mobility issues, There is transportation to the top of the hill if requestedWe visited the Panda enclosuer and waited for 30  mins but didnt see them on any level a return visit later and one had ventured out so we weren't totally dissappointedDidnt find the experience value for money compared to other zoos\/ wild life parks  visited but at least seeen a panda","1492":"Wow what can i say .....","1493":"My friend and i flew up and  visited Edinburgh Zoo because i love bears and they have the Giant Pandas, From arriving we were treated very well, The lady on reception was very welcoming and helpful, (We arrived later than we wanted to due to a flight delay)","1494":"She informed us there was a Giant Panda talk but was very soon, so actually got the mobility car to take us up to the giraffes and then we walked a little bit further so we didnt miss the talk, We spent a couple of hours up with the pandas and i got some beautiful photos ...","1495":"Every  member of staff we walked passed said hello etcI had the unfortunate issue of becoming ill during the afternoon and whilst we was walking around making our way down the Zoo (because i needed to go back to the airport due to the feeling so ill)","1496":"i needed to stop and lean forward due to the pain and discomfort in my tummy, each member of staff that passed us asked if i was ok ...","1497":"Did i need some water...did i need a first aider ...","1498":"They were all so caring and had i of needed their support without a doubt i know i would of been 100% looked after and supported.","1499":"I thought it was trapped wind but on getting medical attention when i got home found out it was actually Gastroenteritis.","1500":"I wished i did not live so far away as i would love to visit more often.","1501":"I felt the need to contact the Zoo once i was home to thank them and to let a manager know what an amazing team they have.","1502":"I spoke to Alex who was just as caring amd lovely as his staff.","1503":"100% recommend a visit and if you love the Giant pandas make it before December as they are returning to china xx","1504":"Huge queues on arrival despite booking a time slot ahead, finally entered and faced more queues as the tiny toilet cubicle upon arrival had one broken.","1505":"Then we discovered many of the enclosures were actually totally empty.","1506":"No penguin parade.","1507":"A lot of very neglected and run down areas with the exception of some new fencing and the chimpanzee area.","1508":"Not one interactive game\/screen working.","1509":"Many of the large animals displayed distress as they were pacing and pacing in their tiny enclosures.","1510":"Given the cost involved in taking a family of 4 to the zoo, I don't think it's wrong to except a significantly more positive experience.","1511":"Easy to find, helpful staff.","1512":"Found the animal talks board in the reception really helpful.","1513":"The zoo is on a very steep hill, so I suggest going up one side\u2026 across the top and then zig zagging back down.","1514":"Some animals were missing but this was due to enclosure refurbishment.","1515":"Not allowed to enter any of the bird enclosures or the lemur walk anymore, both of which are completely understandable.","1516":"Feel that there could be more info on the animals like names, ages etc.","1517":"A great day in general and was lovely to see the pandas before they left.","1518":"Edinburgh Zoo is the first attraction we visited.","1519":"Also famous because it has specimens of pandas, the only ones in Europe (one of my favorite animals - I'm so happy to have been able to see it without having to go to China) and koalas (first time in person).","1520":"There are also other very cute animals.","1521":"The area in which they are placed seemed to be a good size.","1522":"The environments are clean.","1523":"Overall a nice experience.","1524":"Visited the zoo while in Edinburgh for a few days, we wanted to see the pandas again before they leave at the end of the year.","1525":"It is quite steep in places & there are alot of animals to see, we spent between 2 & 3 hours here, didn't use any of the food places as we brought some snacks with us.","1526":"Some interesting animals that we hadn\u2019t seen before, such as koalas, armadillos and of course the fantastic giant pandas.","1527":"However there were a large number of empty exhibits and limited signage explaining which and why, leading to a lot of wasted time spent searching for animals that weren\u2019t there.","1528":"Also very disappointed in the lack of kiosk food and drink available.","1529":"All of your options are located within 50 yards of each other, with nothing at all at the top end of the park when people actually need to stop and take a break having conquered a small mountain.","1530":"Went purely for penguin having watched them on webcam.","1531":"Their enclosure was amazing for them.","1532":"3 kinds of penguins all together.","1533":"They seemed very happy.","1534":"Fell in love with the rhinoceros.","1535":"Felt that some enclosures were too small for animals.","1536":"Cafe okay, price reasonable.","1537":"Staff very very helpful and friendly.","1538":"Would definitely return.","1539":"Lovely walk around the grounds.","1540":"Staff very  very friendly.","1541":"Would definitely return.","1542":"A couple of weeks ago we visited Lakeland Wildlife Oasis in Cumbria for a photography\/birthday visit.","1543":"Despite it being a tiny \"zoo\", we spent the entire day there and had a great time.","1544":"We were so excited to come to Edinburgh Zoo!","1545":"The purpose of our trip was to see the Giant Pandas before they return to China and to see the Koalas, with anything else being a bonus.","1546":"We saw Yang Guang but no sign of Tian Tian.","1547":"But animals are animals, we understand they are never going to be awake when you want them to be.","1548":"It was nice to see some of them - mission almost accomplished.","1549":"We'd left home at 5am and arrived at 10am, to an already large queue.","1550":"Our tickets were pre-booked so getting in was fairly quick.","1551":"We decided to go to the loo first.","1552":"There were just 2 ladies toilets at the entrance and one was out of order so there was quite a queue.","1553":"And that pretty much summed up how our day panned out.","1554":"There were plenty of signs about conservation at the entrance which is great.","1555":"However, when you're paying quite a significant entrance fee it would be nice to actually see some of the animals, sleeping or not.","1556":"Many of the enclosures seemed unkempt (in comparison to other zoos we've been to).","1557":"The windows in most of the enclosures were very dirty, both inside and out making it impossible to get good photos, or in the case of the pandas, to even be able to focus on them.","1558":"I can't imagine the koala bear room has been painted recently, it was very dirty with most of the paint missing around the windows.","1559":"We'd read recently about Rosti being a good place for lunch but we couldn't find it or any sign posts to it.","1560":"We decided to go to Grasslands Restaurant instead but that was closed so we ended up at The Gannet.","1561":"We had chicken burgers and fishcakes and wouldn't recommend either.","1562":"I'd heard all the horror stories about the hill which I was concerned about, being unfit and asthmatic but I assured everyone there was a ride that would take us up there.","1563":"We didn't see any sign of it.","1564":"We thought that was a shame, we would have happily paid extra for a hop-on, hop-off land train or something.","1565":"Anyways, we all made it up the hill with not too much trouble and no asthma attacks so all good.","1566":"Some of the group are very fit and once we'd seen (one) panda, they said there was no way they were going back up there later to see if Tian Tian had made an appearance.","1567":"We'd been so looking forward to our visit but we felt disappointed, so much so that we decided by 3pm that we'd call it a day and go and spend some time in the city before our train journey home.","1568":"Travelled from shropshire to see the giant pandas.","1569":"We are members of Chester zoo.","1570":"Just the one negative point, I\u2019ve been to alot of zoos several times,and never experienced not being able to few animals because the glass divisions screens really needed a wipe over.","1571":"Especially the chimpanzee and meerkats,Other than that throughly enjoyed it , lovely gardens , and very informative volunteers.","1572":"Will be sad to see Tian Tian and Yang  Guang go , hope they\u2019ll settle ok, can\u2019t imagine how their keepers are feeling.","1573":"Xx","1574":"After 32 years I finally got to see a panda...","1575":"well its butt as they slept the whole time lol.","1576":"So first the highs, the animals are happy and healthy and have big natural enclosures, can be difficult to spot for that reason but rather they were in lovely enclosures only one we didn't like was the chimps the glass was so dirty we couldn't see them properly and didn't think the enclosure was as good as the others.","1577":"Good variety of animals , definitely  a full day out, in fact as a disabled visitor missed a fair bit as I was so tired , the views are amazing, now be warned the path to the top is called cardiac path for good reason its sooo steep, but an amazing bonus was they put on a van to transport disabled visitors including wheelchairs to the top, without this I'd never of seen the pandas so this was a great service offered , the man on the gate on arrival was friendly knowledgeable and very helpful unfortunately he did forget to give my the zoo guide I'd paid for but I didn't realise until we got home.","1578":"We travelled 7 hours from England just to visit this zoo and it was amazing  very reasonably priced all the staff friendly and knowledgeable  very happy","1579":"This is utterly depressing and horrible.","1580":"Animals should not be in cages.","1581":"The animals looked depressed, bored and distressed pacing in circles.","1582":"This is no life for them.","1583":"The steep hills in this zoo cannot be stressed enough.","1584":"It was a challenge for an astmatic to get around.","1585":"Managed to see the Pandas, Koalas etc","1586":"but it was impossible to see the lions, sun bears and several other exhibits.","1587":"Disappointingly the Wee Beasties exhibit and Wallaby & Kangaroo Walk were closed as was the restaurant with the best menu.","1588":"We had to manage with the Fish and Chip restaurant but this was not really what we would choose.","1589":"Battered onion rings were sadly not freshly battered as you would expect in a fish and chip restaurant, but were the standard breadcrumbs onion rings you would buy in Tesco!!","1590":"We didn't mind paying the entrance fee because it goes towards conservation but wouldn't visit again.","1591":"Depressing display of animal cruelty.","1592":"Very few animals have adequate enclosures and seem satisfied; the majority appear distressed or bored and have very small cages which you would not expect in a zoo in the 21st century.","1593":"VERY UPSETTING.","1594":"Penguin enclosure is hideous and very dirty as thought not cleaned in months, and many penguins are stood still looking bored and unhappy.","1595":"Really enjoyed our visit here.","1596":"It was quite busy but then is was a Saturday in September with lovely weather.","1597":"Highlights were probably the chomps and penguins!","1598":"Unfortunately I have to say that I did not appreciate the visit.","1599":"Despite a price that is certainly not cheap, the park is not well kept.","1600":"Very poorly maintained, rather dirty gardens, several empty cages.","1601":"I found the indoor placement of the monkeys in a very dark area very sad.","1602":"The penguin area is beautiful.","1603":"But in general I felt a certain sense of abandonment.","1604":"I visited the zoo and had a good day.","1605":"I decided to take out a joint membership as it clearly states on their website if you've visited the zoo and take out membership your tickets will be refunded.","1606":"It also clearly states on their website to join first THEN contact the zoo for refund of tickets.","1607":"What it doesn't state anywhere is if you don't buy your tickets from the zoo then you'll get an email from Peter in Membership Services stating they don't refund the ticket.","1608":"I bought mine through my employer.","1609":"The zoo obviously still get the admission fee and if they get slightly less then just refund the amount they got.","1610":"Very short sighted as they now have nothing as I cancelled my joint membership and therfore they have lost out on this and future years memberships along with money I would have spent during my visits.","1611":"Rost Cafe at 16:00 on the 3rd of September 2023, similar to a previous review  the staff in this caf\u00e9 were very cheeky and unhelpful, the window was open with no sign and i asked them if their food was halal they said yh","1612":"but you do know were closed right in a very cheeky tone.","1613":"There were no signs and the window was closed.","1614":"This ruined it for us no idea how they are still operating in the park given they cant even handle basic customer requests with decency.","1615":"The only reason I gave it 2 reviews is the actual zoo it's self was really good, but I would avoid this caf\u00e9, it was 1 guy working here at the time above","1616":"Steep hill the ENTIRE zoo but it hade a wide range of animals so it was worth the upphill climb, the toilets were clean for have so much traffic.","1617":"Downside was that we had pre-bought tickets for 11 but when we arrived the que was not moving and aaaaall the way up to the parking and beyond.","1618":"So I recommend coming at 12 or later to avoid it, we also went on a saturday so we expected there would be alot of people but we werent ready for the long que lol.","1619":"Visited as a family of 4 travelled up from wales for a few days ,kids were super excited todo the zoo but left a little disappointed.","1620":"Lots of areas were closed off, viewing areas etc","1621":"and it felt a little run down.(broken fences overgrown areas also seen lots of mice)It was very hilly not a problem for us but cant imagine anyone with mobility issues would cope.","1622":"Overall we had a good day kids enjoyed seeing the animals and lots of baby ones too , but i do feel it was a  very expensive couple of hours out!","1623":"We came for the pandas before they go.","1624":"As we were staying in the city centre we visited by bus which was easy once we set up the app.","1625":"Note the zoo is on a hill and if you go all the way to the top you\u2019ll see some nice views.","1626":"Plenty of food places about and a large variety of animals.","1627":"We spent 6 hours here before heading back.","1628":"Absolutely incredible zoo!","1629":"The zoo is situated up a hill which provides spectacular views across the city, but it can be a bit difficult for accessibility as the hills are incredibly steep!","1630":"Pricing is very reasonable as you know where the money is going when you see how well cared for all the animals are.","1631":"Mid summer break we went and still all the animals were content in enclosures full of food and enrichment items.","1632":"It was an honor to see the giant pandas so close as well!All the staff we interacted with were friendly and polite, especially the guest services\/gift shop staff who seemed as excited as we were!","1633":"Engaged with us about the trip too and seemed genuinely pleased to be working there.","1634":"I was really looking forward to going to the zoo, but I was quite disappointed.","1635":"The enclosures were very overgrown, a lot of the pens were vacant, and the entire zoo is very steep, so anyone with mobility issues should be warned of this before going there.","1636":"It was a really poor trip overall, which is a big shame because if money was spent, it might be a magnificent zoo.","1637":"For dinner, we had burger and chips in the park, which weren't very tasty, and cold coffee and tea, too.","1638":"I\u2019ve been to lots of zoos all over the world and this is one of the most disappointing the animals do look well fed and cared for on a positive note which is the main thing.","1639":"The exit from the zoo could do with some traffic lights it\u2019s not the easiest when turning right having to cut across lanes  of traffic on a busy road","1640":"I have been visiting this zoo on and off since I was 3.","1641":"I am now in my late 50s.","1642":"I\u2019m sad to say that the place is completely overgrown with weeds especially in the enclosures.","1643":"In my opinion it is not nearly as good as it used to be and I won\u2019t be returning","1644":"Second visit to the zoo, the first one since covid,Really enjoyed our trip here.","1645":"We did struggle to navigate our way, however the volunteers are fab!","1646":"Helped us find our way, we also stopped in the restaurant on site!","1647":"Reasonable prices and really good portions!The animals are in great enclosures to find.","1648":"Would recommend wearing very comfortable shoes for walking as the hills are steep!However we always start at the top of the zoo and work our way down!The added bonus of plenty of indoor areas such as the koalas and sloths mean if it rains we can go indoors then back outside to enjoy the rest of the zoo,The pandas are great to see and we loved our trip there, the animal talks are great to get the most out of your visit!","1649":"Highly recommend!","1650":"Had a lovely day at the zoo.","1651":"Made the long journey mainly to see the pandas before they go back home.","1652":"Obviously very hilly, which made it a very tiring day.","1653":"My son especially enjoyed watching the armadillos running about their enclosure.","1654":"Very friendly staff .","1655":"Very pleased we could gain free entry into this zoo by using the reciprocal arrangement with our local zoo Marwell Wildlife.","1656":"Do wonder how the zoo will cope when the pandas return to China as they are a very big attraction.","1657":"The zoo was lovely and clean in all the areas.","1658":"Zoo keepers are all around the park and are available to engage with and they are very knowledgeable about all the animals along with interesting facts.","1659":"Enclosures all seem well maintained and large enough to house the animals in them.","1660":"There are lots of areas to eat with a range of foods and snacks.","1661":"There are plenty of areas to sit and eat picnics too.","1662":"Parking was cheap at \u00a33.00 for the day unlike some tourist attraction car parking fees.","1663":"Lovely day out.","1664":"It was a fun day out!","1665":"i especially enjoyed the pandas , hippos and zebras and also the giraffes all the food was unreal and was very clean and overall a great day out","1666":"We had such a great time, with lots to see (although not all exhibitis were open.","1667":"Plenty of toilets and some food establishments within.","1668":"My only negative was that it is set on a very high slope.","1669":"Gorgeous views from the very top over the city, but if you aren't good with a long up hill walk and back down again this attraction may not be for you.","1670":"It's been a quite since we.last visited the zoo but really enjoyed it.","1671":"seeing the giraffes was amazing and my daughter loved the penquins , was really nice to visit again after such a long time.","1672":"We pre booked our tickets for our trip to the zoo.","1673":"The queue went down very quickly as the staff were efficient.","1674":"The signage was very helpful.","1675":"Plenty of places to eat and drink and lots of toilets dotted around.","1676":"The play parks were a nice size for kids.","1677":"Came here as last minute change of plan.","1678":"Its an okay zoo not nearly as good as london zoo.","1679":"The penguin bit is good but are much better zoos for that price.","1680":"Too hilly and challenging with pushchairs and disabilities.","1681":"No warning of how this is.","1682":"Spoilt the day and many enclosures empty.","1683":"A shed load of hill climbs with no reward.","1684":"Also map is basic and signage so not easy to navigate the zoo without continually doubling back.","1685":"Not enough toilets or picnic areas.","1686":"Very disappointing and probably will not return","1687":"Edinburgh zoo is lovely!","1688":"We had a great day walking around.","1689":"All the zoo keepers were friendly, and a few stopped to chat to us as we walked around.","1690":"The few keeper talk we stopped at were interesting- kangaroos and pandas.","1691":"The keeper at the sloth spent a long time talking to us about the sloths.","1692":"Pandas are definitely worth seeing before they leave!","1693":"I don\u2019t like to criticise the zoo because I think they do good work, but the place is rather scruffy these days.","1694":"We had pre-booked but still had to queue to get in, there  was plenty of room in the car park.","1695":"Our visit was primarily to see the pandas and we had a good view of one of them, although they aren\u2019t an entertaining animal.","1696":"The giraffes were very engaging and the koalas charming.","1697":"For a site which is so difficult to get around, the signage needs to be better to ensure you aren\u2019t doubling back to see missed animals, and the map in the handout is vague.","1698":"We didn\u2019t see the tigers or lions and the sun bear only put in brief appearance.","1699":"Many of the compounds need smartening up, there were bits of broken fencing, untidy unused areas and the viewing windows for the penguins were covered in algae.","1700":"It seems like the place is just past its best and needs some investment to keep it relevant.","1701":"So disappointed at the empty and overgrown enclosures, interactive buttons did not work and loose wires in places.","1702":"Thought they would promote more the feeding times for the animals so we and our grandchildren could see them.","1703":"An expensive afternoon and thank goodness we took sandwiches rather than \u00a314 for fish and chips, never again.","1704":"Been a long time since I have been to this particular zoo, was a lot younger and must have been fitter then to.","1705":"It\u2019s very hilly so take advantage of the shuttle service to top off the hill.","1706":"Animals looked happy enough well fed.","1707":"My 6 year old niece love the dinosaur exhibit and the giraffes there was a lot to keep her entertained.","1708":"Food was expensive but the quality wasn\u2019t up to the price, but we had a packed lunch in car and I could not be bothered going to get it so all our own fault.","1709":"Overall was a great day  most of the interactive stuff was broken and need to be fixed.","1710":"Staff were great and I am sure would answer any questions people had.","1711":"Highly recommend","1712":"We loved our day out in the zoo, the beautiful nature, and of course the animals.","1713":"We were sad to see that a few people smoked there despite the signs at the entrance but that's not the staff's fault.1 star knocked off for the food in the Penguin's Cafe - the salad and the sourdough baguette were so dry that I found them hard to eat.","1714":"The salad needs a dressing or at least olive oil on it, and actually more vegetables, and the baguette needs more butter and vegetables too to make it less dry.","1715":"Cakes could be better home made of course, especially for the price.","1716":"We were gutted we ate at the Penguin's cafe because we then saw a much more varied menu at the Giraffe Cafe at the top which we will try next time.","1717":"Perhaps it could be signposted more on the map, same as the other cafe.","1718":"My son and I had a very enjoyable 4hrs at the zoo today!","1719":"We\u2019d not been in over a year, and a few enclosures lie empty and the monkey house down past the penguins is also closed.","1720":"That said it was bustling and lots of animals were out for us to enjoy!","1721":"We were keen to see the pandas one last time.","1722":"The zoo is well kept and it was extremely busy (not to the point it affected our visit).We had lunch in the Gannet fish bar which we enjoyed (not that cheap if youre on a tight budget).For the two of us we spent just over \u00a350 on entry and lunch.","1723":"We will return, most likely in spring\/2024.","1724":"Edinburgh Zoo offers an exciting adventure into the world of animals.","1725":"While the zoo has a small downside, some may see it as an advantage too: it's quite hilly and can be challenging for families to explore all areas.","1726":"But don't worry!","1727":"The zoo provides a transfer service to the top of the hill, so you can walk downhill and take in all the wonders.","1728":"Unfortunately, we missed a few animals uphill because it was hard to go back up again.","1729":"On the bright side, there are plenty of spots to rest and catch your breath along the way.","1730":"We didn't have any issues with long entrance queues, and the zoo is kept clean and tidy and the staff members are friendly and helpful,","1731":"We travelled from Newcastle specifically to visit the zoo for one day.","1732":"My two children (age 10 & 6) we\u2019re disappointed within the first 10 minutes of arriving, as we\u2019re the adults.","1733":"It\u2019s easy to get to, 20mins by bus from Waverley and entry for 4 was \u00a380.Without going into too much detail, we barely saw many \u2018key\u2019 animals, they were resting or hiding behind the foliage.","1734":"(I understand they\u2019re probably sick of visitors and they\u2019re not in their natural habitat)Most of the interactive and educational exhibits were broken.","1735":"We kind of expected more talks from the staff about the animals on show but apart from the scheduled times, which didn\u2019t seem to be advertised on entry and subsequently we missed, there was little interaction with visitors.","1736":"Of course we planned on the walking and steep hills, hats off to those parents with buggies and the elderly, it was a bit of a hard slog getting round.","1737":"I\u2019d recommend taking a packed lunch, the gannet restaurant, a kids meal portion was good small size for little ones but at \u00a38pp a little overpriced.","1738":"(Also take note of bottle filling stations as it\u2019s also \u00a32 a can of still water).The main thing my children liked was the face painting lady (\u00a35 per child and she was amazing) and the gift shop for obvs reasons.","1739":"I don\u2019t think I\u2019d recommend the zoo and I doubt we\u2019d be back.","1740":"\ud83e\udd37","1741":"\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f","1742":"Edinburgh zoo is well worth a visit.","1743":"There are lots of interesting animals to see and there is plenty of information about them.","1744":"A particular highlight has to be seeing the 2 giant panda's before they return to China at the end of the year.","1745":"Seeing my favourite animal up close is something I for one will certainly never forget.","1746":"All of the animals are obviously well cared for and seem genuinely relaxed and at home within their environments.","1747":"There are lots of opportunities to spot the animals from different viewing areas (including inside enclosures), which was handy during our visit as it poured with rain!There are lots of places to eat, a large play area for children, a reasonably priced gift shop to cater for all budgets and very friendly staff.","1748":"There is even an opportunity to rent a locker to store luggage in etc if you are travelling in the area for just the day, which was an ingenious idea that more tourist attractions would benefit from offering.","1749":"All in all I would highly recommend Edinburgh zoo, it is well worth the visit","1750":"and I guarantee you will not be disappointed.","1751":"Very nice and large zoo with many animals kept in large, well-kept spaces.","1752":"The pandas, koalas and the vast area with king penguins are very beautiful.","1753":"Easily reachable by bus with a stop right in front of the zoo.","1754":"Absolutely worth seeing.","1755":"We prebooked our tickets & car parking the day before we visited BUT we had to queue half an hour as there was no fast tracking !","1756":"We thought this very poor as you have walk ins on the day & those who have bought tickets but no priority for the latter so you actually miss what\u2019s programmed at that time of the day as you can\u2019t physically walk in!We brought our own lunch with us & queued for the ice cream kiosk","1757":"but we left it as they were very expensive at \u00a36.50 each but it appeared to be making the ice cream & requested flavours on the spot , we moved on to another kiosk for the usual tubs of ice cream & cornettos & ice lollies.","1758":"The play areas were fun & for different age groups .The panda talk was really interesting","1759":"but we all had to stand round the speaker & try & get close to the boundary fence to see the panda who was out & eating bamboo.","1760":"I think it would have been much better to have a seated venue indoors & have his presentation there.","1761":"All the volunteers were very helpful & informative so well done to you all & much appreciated.","1762":"We had lovely sunny weather so a great day out for us all !","1763":"I would never go again !!!!","1764":"It was so hilly , you have to be fit.","1765":"It was dirty and hard to find some of the animals who all looked so lethargic which was sad to see","1766":"We spent a few days in Edinburgh with the focus of our visit being the zoo!","1767":"It didn\u2019t disappoint.","1768":"We saw all the animals and there were different viewpoints throughout.","1769":"The enclosures seemed big and we were there all day.","1770":"It is on a hill but plenty of spaces to stop if needed.","1771":"We ate our lunch watching the gibbons which was entertaining and all the staff we saw throughout the day were friendly.","1772":"I would recommend.","1773":"First time to Scotland and wanted to visit Edinburgh zoo to see the pandas before they go back to China.","1774":"Booked tickets online beforehand to avoid queues, so we're very disappointed to find a very long queue that went up to the top of the car park (which was full, so we had to park on main road, although this actually worked out betternon the end as it was a downhill walk at the end of the day).","1775":"After queueing to get in, we made our way to the Gannet restaurant for lunch and enjoyed a nice meal.","1776":"The penguin enclosure was great, and it was great to see the pandas.","1777":"But for us, without the pandas, I'm not quite sure what will draw people to Edinburgh zoo.","1778":"There are many better zoos out there (Marwell, Longleat etc) that have more space for the animals, easier to get around, better view points and places to see the animals.","1779":"The zoo seemed very overgrown, so much so that we hardly saw anything.","1780":"The penguins, the otters, the pandas, the goats and one monkeyThe zoo is so hilly and we saw a lot of people struggling with that.","1781":"Really not a zoo for the unfit or those pushing buggies or wheelchairs.","1782":"We made it to the view point at the very top of the zoo to see the view of Edinburgh,  only to be disappointed because you couldn't see anything because the trees etc were blocking the view.","1783":"So there wasn't a view at the view point after all...the best view point we found was back down the hill.","1784":"We left pretty quickly after seeing the pandas.","1785":"Very disappointed and wouldn't go back.","1786":"Sorry to say but I wouldn't recommend.","1787":"Very disappointed with the whole experience.","1788":"Not very clean, poor directions.","1789":"Husband uses a power wheelchair some areas very difficult to negotiate.","1790":"One particular disabled toilet had a yale lock which he had to struggle to stand up to exit the toilet very bad.. Would not recommend.","1791":"The zoo is clean and tidy.","1792":"Staff were friendly.","1793":"Be warned very steep hills to walk up.","1794":"We didn\u2019t know this and would probably not have gone.","1795":"Animal enclosures are overgrown in quite a few.","1796":"The poor bears seem stressed and pacing back and forth in the indoor enclosure.","1797":"Penguin area was great.","1798":"It\u2019s could be so much more but this would mean lots of money put back into it.","1799":"Wow!","1800":"What a brilliant place!","1801":"Obviously a lot of investment has gone into the chimp and penguin areas as there were outstanding.","1802":"We went though to see the pandas before they go back to China and that was just an amazing experience to see such a gorgeous animal.","1803":"I wasn't expecting the zoo to be quite as hilly as it was which is my own fault for not researching it but there was plenty of places to sit.","1804":"The customer service was also excellent and deserves a mention as staff stop to talk to us at various times during the day, sharing information.","1805":"It made the day feel extra special as we discovered so much and is something we haven't experienced at other zoo's without going to formal talks etc","1806":"Really enjoyable day out.","1807":"Many animals not seen at other zoos in the UK.","1808":"Eg koalas, panda bears, sloths.","1809":"Well kept grounds.","1810":"A wonderfully beautiful day at the zoo.","1811":"Online reservation, very fast entry.","1812":"Very large and quite pleasant zoo.","1813":"My girls had a great time.","1814":"Just disappointed that the felines were hidden but it happens.","1815":"Amazing Zoo with a great variety of things to see and do on speaking to someone who works there and learning about the international Breeding Program and how good conservation is here.","1816":"I am delighted to have enjoyed my visit so much.","1817":"I want to thank the animal volunteer Simon for his extensive knowledge and a great deal of help you was prior to my visit.","1818":"We absolutely love zoos, so knowing that we were having a holiday in Scotland I booked tickets for the zoo.","1819":"The zoo us on a high hill, as I walk with a stick the lady checking us in asked if we would like a lift to the top of the zoo in the accessible vehicle.","1820":"I would recommend this to anyone who has trouble walking.","1821":"We got out at the top and walked down seeing all the animals.","1822":"Loved the Pandas although they are leaving the zoo at the end of the year.","1823":"Would return next time we're in Edinburgh.","1824":"Booked day before for 11am on arrival car park was closed off as it was full.","1825":"Took us an hour to find suitable parking elsewhere.","1826":"Didn't arrive at the zoo til 12.30pm.","1827":"Very disappointed there was noone there to advise on suitable parking.","1828":"Very well laid out and a most enjoyable day out.","1829":"Great for all ages.","1830":"We used to visit over a decade ago and they have clearly made some substantial improvements since then.","1831":"Two issues they need to address: too many ponds \/ pools are standing stagnant water which should be upgraded to continuous flowing irrigation; and the public toilets are in desperate need of an upgrade.","1832":"If you want to visit a run down zoo without hardly any animals then come to Edinburgh zoo.","1833":"If you like mountain trekking you will love this zoo.","1834":"I felt sorry for mums with prams or any wheelchair users trying to navigate the zoo!","1835":"The pandas are amazing and koalas and penguins.","1836":"Grounds aren't well maintained and very sparse with other animals.","1837":"Go to Colchester or London or Chester.","1838":"Much better zois to visit.","1839":"Paths are very confusing and most of the animals look bored and sad.","1840":"The water for the penguins was filthy and you could hardly see them swimming underwater.","1841":"Most of the indoor areas are very smelly and in need of a spruce up.","1842":"Pandas were great though.","1843":"Went to the Grasslands Restaurant.","1844":"Bought 2 child soups and 1 adult.","1845":"They were all the same but the adult one cost more.","1846":"Soup barely warm.","1847":"Chips pale, tepid and uninteresting.","1848":"Best avoided.","1849":"On our recent visit to Edinburgh zoo we were very disappointed.","1850":"No clear instructions on the paths to get to the animals lots is doubling back on yourself.as for the animals they are very concerning most looked depressed and their living conditions are not very good!!","1851":"The Pygmy hippo had no muck just dried ground!","1852":"The sun bear had no water to play in ?","1853":"The water the penguins enclosure is filthy!!","1854":"Maybe the staff need a bit more training on how these animals live!!","1855":"The animals don\u2019t look stimulated at all \ud83d\ude22 for the cost of entry for a family it\u2019s very disappointing!","1856":"The toilets are disgusting and even the paths on the way around are messy!","1857":"I used to love this zoo but it now feels very unloved and very messy I feel sorry for the animals.","1858":"Rost Cafe at 14.05 on the 30th of July 2023, the staff in this caf\u00e9 were very cheeky and unhelpful, my son asked for me if they sold lattes and the staff said \"No do you you think this is Starbucks\", my son then said I was only asking for my parents to which they replied \"They should know better\" and they laughted at him, terrible way to treat customers.","1859":"The only reason I gave it 2 reviews is the actual zoo it's self was really good, but I would avoid this caf\u00e9, it was 2 guys working here at the time above","1860":"We planned to go here from our campsite we were staying, we booked online, paying near enough \u00a3100 for all of us so would think we would be able to park in car park\u2026..","1861":"No,we were told to park on the street, couldn\u2019t get parked so had to park 20 minute walk away on a housing estate before we endured e our trek to the zoo and all those steep hills, wish I had known how hilly it was going to be by maybe reading some reviews before I went!","1862":"Pleased we hired a stroller for my little one or else she would\u2019ve struggled and it\u2019s a bit of a trek pushing up those steep banksWe Seen some animals but a lot we struggled to  see and a lot we missed as not massively signposted and would\u2019ve ended walking around (steep) banks and didn\u2019t have the energy.","1863":"The general feel of the zoo was a bit run down and a bit dated, loos were not nice and I felt a bit sad for the animals, it was an ok day, we can say we\u2019ve been but in my opinion, it\u2019s overrated.","1864":"Came here to see the pandas before they return to China later this year and this trip was made by seeing the pandas.","1865":"Other than the pandas this zoo has some other great animals but dosent have many compared to over zoos that I have visited.","1866":"The zoo is on a hill so just be cautious if your not good on your legs or have buggy\u2019s.","1867":"Over then that great place to spend a day","1868":"Visited on our break to Edinburgh.","1869":"Came for the panda bears and they didn\u2019t disappoint, nice to see them before they go back.","1870":"The zoo is pretty steep as on a hill so this was ok for us but beware if you are older, can\u2019t walk as well etc .","1871":"The zoo was nice to walk around for a few hours and plenty to see, we also loved the koalas, not as big as our local zoo in Chester but passed a few hours whilst away .","1872":"Lovely walk around the creative paths and enclosures, incredible animals to see up close.","1873":"Also the staff were brilliant and kept my phone safe after I left it behind.","1874":"Thanks guys!","1875":"Phew","1876":"Very steep in areas but well worth a visit.","1877":"Came specifically for the panda bears and they were very close and visible.","1878":"Good zoo!","1879":"Disappointed is an understatement.","1880":"I am a single mum, on holiday in Scotland, the ticket price is quite high, 40 pounds for me and my daughter.","1881":"Ok it will be an amazing day, no worries about the money.","1882":"When arrived, we queued for 45 minutes just to get in... at the entrance we had to pay another 3 pounds for parking....","1883":"the zoo is on a hillside and we missed few animals just because we were tired at the end.","1884":"Poor oldies hold their walking sticks, tried to keep up with their families, it was so sad.","1885":"The parts which normally had water in it were all empty, like the small lake at the left and the waterfall thing.","1886":"Extreme amounts of weed everywhere, looks like it was closed years ago.","1887":"One scoop of ice cream 2.70, not surprised there was nobody in front.","1888":"We are regular visitors in zoos, we visited at least 30 in different countries and many around the Uk, and we never felt this disappointment.","1889":"The penguin encounter is dated,the underwater window was so dirty and green we couldn't see anything.","1890":"Enclosures are full of weed too....","1891":"I know I will get the  answer that there are 2500 animals there, but it contains the cockroaches and fish....","1892":"yeah","1893":"I know I support the animals","1894":"but I can hardly see what they get of my and others money, I have never been in a zoo like this, very disappointed and sad for my daughter as she seen and mentioned these as well as a 14 years old.","1895":"As a qualified vet assistant I feel horrible after the day out.","1896":"I am a member of Chester Zoo so was able to visit Edinburgh Zoo on my Chester Zoo  membership (so can't say if it was value for money)I booked online so was surprised to have to queue despite this.","1897":"However the queue moves fast enough.","1898":"Loved seeing the animals they don't have at Chester; the Scottish Wildcats, the Koalas and the Giant Pandas.","1899":"Edinburgh Zoo is very steep in places so just be aware of that.","1900":"The penguin area is great, although maybe needs freshening up.","1901":"A little expensive but well worth the moneyIt was a great day out, plenty of seats dotted about for a rest also I think 3 cafesAnimals all looked well cared for and happyDefinately would return!","1902":"Very disappointed.","1903":"Family trip out , 4 children , 2 grandparents 1 of whom is in a wheel chair , and 1 adult spending way over \u00a3133 .","1904":"Although they provide a car \/ van to get to the top , not only do you miss all the animals , you also have to get back down .","1905":"The hills are pretty steep in places .","1906":"So not wheel chair friendly at all , quick enough to take the money though :(  .","1907":"Overall it did spoil our day , and quite a lot of empty enclosures .","1908":"Brilliant day out!","1909":"If you haven\u2019t been, you should!So many fantastic animals that you don\u2019t often see in smaller zoos, in lovely big enclosures.","1910":"Play areas of children and regular pit stops with bathrooms and ice creams.","1911":"Very hilly, so wear comfy shoes!","1912":"Thoroughly enjoyed our day.","1913":"All the animals looked healthy and happy and in great enclosures that were clean and spacious.","1914":"Just felt a bit sorry for Mr Lion :-(Many thanks to the volunteer Irene - she was amazing!","1915":"So informative and helpful and chatty.","1916":"Totally made our day with all the stories and information she shared, thank you.","1917":"A great day out but sooooo steep!!","1918":"Eat your 3 Weetabix before you set off :-)","1919":"Incredible day!","1920":"Visiting brought back so many memories of when I was a kid and the sense of magic I felt came flooding back, especially given how much it has changed since that time.","1921":"Returning after a number of years with a family of my own and seeing the excitement of my boys will be something I won't forget in a hurry.","1922":"The zoo itself is incredible!","1923":"The exhibits and enclosures are amazing and it is the only zoo I have visited where you really feel the animals are loved and cared for.","1924":"The weather was fantastic on our visit and we saw every animal enjoying the sun.","1925":"We decided to put the map away and discover everything we could on our own and I would recommend doing this to anyone who visits.","1926":"A personal highlight was watching Jay the Asian Lion patrol  his enclosure and roar right in front of us.","1927":"There was no Penguin parade which my boys were a bit disappointed by but it was completely understandable given the avain flu epidemic but the enclosure is massive so they were happy to spend ages watching them.","1928":"I was also really interested in the research the Zoo is doing with the animals, especially in the Capuchin and Squirrel Monkey enclosures, I had a really good talk with one of the staff (I wish I could remember her name)  about what is happening and what they have observed so far.","1929":"I could write a novel about this one day but all in all, a brilliant day, a world class zoo, well cared for animals and the most helpful and passionate staff you'll ever meet.","1930":"We're going to do the keeper experience in the near future and can not wait.","1931":"Thank you Edinburgh Zoo for a phenomenal day!","1932":"Dirty unkept grounds outside, internal spaces are dusty.","1933":"Very bad planning of grounds leaving open wasted spaces and small enclosures for the animals.1st zoo visit I've ever felt sorry for the animals.","1934":"Tiger looks malnourished and pacing in circles, visibly looked stressed.","1935":"Bears, saw them inside the enclosure, one looked to be walking out, turned round walked back, then turned again.....for atleast 5 minutes before I walked away.","1936":"Red Pandas have 2 trees they can access whilst surrounded to atleast 10.All other animals were asleep, probably tired from pacing.","1937":"Biggest featured are the Pandas which are leaving due to a successful petition to send them home.","1938":"Minimal large or exotic animals, it's more like a glorified petting zoo.","1939":"I really do feel sorry for the animals here and there treatment.","1940":"Add to the fact its on the side of a steep hill just confirmed my distain.","1941":"Much improved for last visit - although busy plenty room to view animals - map was useful!!","1942":"Disappointing that all the drinks stations were card only - not handy as many children and families may just want an ice cream.","1943":"Also disappointing that the optional gift aid was added without an explanation - lucky for me I was not \"conned\" - however overall value for money!!","1944":"One of the best zoo\u2019s we\u2019ve ever been to (and we\u2019ve been to quite a lot).Firstly, the zoo does have some steep hills and we were aware of that before visiting, I don\u2019t feel it deserves to be marked down for this though.","1945":"Upon entry, we were also warned of this and asked if we needed any assistance.","1946":"All of the animal enclosures were phenomenal.","1947":"The penguin enclosure was absolutely huge and was surrounded by the loveliest and most helpful staff and volunteers.","1948":"They shared their experiences and told us about the penguins.","1949":"The panda exhibits were also great.","1950":"At the start of the day; they were mostly inside chomping on fresh bamboo but around midday they ventured outside.","1951":"It was so great to see these animals before they go back to China later on this year - a great species to be up close and personal","1952":"to!The giraffes are always one of my favourites and we met a lovely volunteer called Theresa.","1953":"She told us many stories of the 5 giraffes and it was amazing to see her enthusiasm.","1954":"She is a credit to the zoo.","1955":"The red panda exhibits were also a personal favourite and both enclosures were really great.","1956":"Overall, the enclosures exceeded my expectations and the zoo provided a great full day out.","1957":"It\u2019s far too big to complete in half a day.","1958":"We will definitely be back for sure - thank you for a brilliant day out.","1959":"Been a few times to this zoo a decided to do the sundown experience (not worth it) they fail to mention the close enclosures or lock animals away so if you want to see the animals go during the day.","1960":"The primates for a better word looked like they bad been put to sleep last time I checked they aren\u2019t nocturnalAnd certainly not all asleep at 7pm.","1961":"The experiences they sell they focus on main animals if you want to see another animal it seems you have to for out a \u00a3550 donation or they tell you you can\u2019t do experience with that animal.","1962":"Extremely weird set up the more you visit the more you see things aren\u2019t what they seem monkey numbers dwindling penguin babies arrived and now adult numbers dropped.","1963":"The monkey testing that causes mental distress is classed as behavioural testing considering they are literally a gene step from us I wouldn\u2019t want to be locked in a plastic box forced to do puzzles or react to images, if you really look at what\u2019s going on you would be dumbfounded how bad things can be also wildcat is a cat my bengals are more wild than that thing.","1964":"Good to visit during day don\u2019t do sundown don\u2019t visit too often you start to notice things you wish you didn\u2019t and take your own food and drink and comfy shoes and watch out for staff driving like Mario cart","1965":"Really enjoyed the zoo.","1966":"First time having visited it, with the shuttle bus being efficient as well as entry.","1967":"The shows and Pandas were great.","1968":"It is quite a lot of walking though!","1969":"Will happily return once I am back.","1970":"Visited today with our grandsons,one of whom is obsessed with sloths.","1971":"The sloth house was fantastic!","1972":"Although not a cheap day out it was a while day filled with excellent opportunities to see so many animals, the dinosaurs at the top of the hill were an added bonus..","1973":"The staff at reception were incredibly friendly , the gift shop had a huge range of options from a couple of pounds upwards and the toilets were clean.","1974":"Can't recommend the zoo highly enough and we'll definitely be back again.","1975":"I had a lovely trip here last week!","1976":"It's been a while since I last went, and my health has deteriorated significantly since then, but they have a mobility vehicle that can take you to the top of the hill which made a massive difference to me.","1977":"I still wasn't able to access all of the zoo due to a lot of the steep hills, certain paths were just far too steep, however I did get to see most of the zoo, and far more than I would have done without the assistance provided by the zoo.","1978":"It was really lovely for me to be able to get out and see the zoo at all, and it really cheered me up.","1979":"The talks were really enjoyable and informative, and I chatted to some of the staff members who were really friendly.","1980":"The animals looked to be in good condition and it was fantastic to see so many, although it is a shame that the Penguin Parade is unable to run just now.","1981":"Really good day out, and highly recommend.","1982":"What a fantastic day out \u2026 my mate and I weren\u2019t entirely sure if we were","1983":"zoo people","1984":"but I knew I was super keen to see the pandas before they headed home later this year.","1985":"So on a slightly damp July morning, we headed to Corstorphine \u2026 what a great day despite occasional rain!Firstly a big shout out to all the staff, who were so informed and willing to answer questions (even when we\u2019d missed the panda talk) \u2026 it was like the animals were old friends \u2026 just lovely.","1986":"Secondly, As I said, we weren\u2019t sure we were zoo people per se but perhaps the exception of the eagle and the parrots it felt like there was plenty of space for the creatures to roam (although perhaps the uk\u2019s avian bird flu troubles may have been a factor for the birds).Thirdly, a great selection of eateries and refreshment stands dotted about the place and loos too so plenty of places for a wee rest if needed.","1987":"And if you\u2019re worried about the steepness \u2026 neither of us are at peak fitness but we managed rightly\u2026 a nice gentle stroll \u2026 saw most things and I think we\u2019d fine 8500 steps by the end \u2026 you can hire mobility scooters I think if needed.","1988":"So definitely a grand day out \u2026 the pandas did not roller skate (ref Kit Kat advert) but they were magnificent powerful agile and gorgeous looking creatures \u2026 I\u2019m sure they will be missed \u2026 so glad I got to see them before they go home.","1989":"The Zoo itself, while obviously dated, is absolutely fine and the 6 year old throughly enjoyed it .","1990":"The toilet facilities and play parks were really good for younger ones however the place itself is massively let down by its food outlets.","1991":"The one we tried, the Gannet Fish Bar, was horrendous with the worst fish and chips I\u2019ve ever tasted.","1992":"The child\u2019s fish portion was no bigger than a fish finger and cost \u00a37.50 and heaven knows what kind of fish it was but I\u2019m sure it would have bounced.","1993":"Unfortunately we had to leave earlier than planned to go 8th the city centre for something decent to eat before the long journey home","1994":"We visited yesterday 3rd July with our grandsons aged 4 and 2 for what we hoped would be a fantastic day out.","1995":"Now we did have a good day out but not a fantastic one.","1996":"Firstly we were very disappointed at the condition of the areas adjacent to many of the footpaths as there were many weeds including stinging nettles and thistles all readily in a small child's reach especially around some of the viewing areas of the animal pens.","1997":"Also we tried to purchase white coffee from a kiosk at the top of the park beside the dinosaurs picnic area only to be told they only sell black coffee and I'd have to go back down to another kiosk at the bottom of the park beside the penguin's.","1998":"Ridiculous really that you can't get a plain white coffee!!.","1999":"However, what was most concerning is that later in the day we went to purchase ice-cream for our grandsons  one of which has egg, nut and sesame allergies and the staff at the penguin parlour kiosk were unable to advise if the ice-cream or the cones contained any of these.","2000":"We were offered the wafer box to check for ourselves but they had no idea about the ice-cream.","2001":"Considering the high profile of Natashas law recently,  I would have expected a high profile venue to have been familiar with this and had lists at all of your kiosks.","2002":"You can imagine the disappointment from my grandsons that I wasn't able to get them ice-cream as I had promised.","2003":"Overall we did have an enjoyable day out but the zoo I felt overall wasn't as well kept as I remember from my previous visits as both a child and taking my own children to.","2004":"Brilliant zoo, we went on a rainy day and were a bit worried it would be pointless in the rain.","2005":"However, was a brilliant trip with lots of places the hide and lots of tree coverage so we didn\u2019t get too soaked!","2006":"Felt like there was lots of space and didn\u2019t ever feel too busy or crowded.","2007":"The zoo was great but what made it better was the incredible food waiting at the top!","2008":"R\u00f2st near the dinosaurs is incredible.","2009":"I had the chicken burger and my husband had the beef brisket and it was genuinely some of the best food we have eaten in Edinburgh.","2010":"The guys who run it are amazing and super friendly.","2011":"If you\u2019re heading to the zoo R\u00f2st is a must and a great place to eat after the big climb up the hill!!","2012":"Amazing trip out, even in the pouring rain.","2013":"Lots of tree coverage meant it wasn't a complete washout!","2014":"It didn't ever feel too busy or crowded.","2015":"To top everything off, a visit to Rost at the very top of the Hill.","2016":"Incredible brisket beef on fries, and lovely staff was just what we needed after a long hike up the hill!","2017":"Would certainly recommend to anyone who makes it that far!","2018":"Spent fantastic few hours with a friend,  and would highly recommend visiting.","2019":"Although the weather was quite poor, it didn\u2019t deter us and meant that it wasn\u2019t too busy with other guests and we didn\u2019t have to wait in queues to enter any areas.","2020":"We saw so many incredible species, sometimes you just need to be patient and understand that animals may not like the crowds to come out.","2021":"All staff were very friendly and welcoming and were on hand to chat and answer any questions.","2022":"Special shout out to Jess and Sarah who were on duty in armadillos and sloths enclosure, so knowledgable, friendly and just couldn\u2019t do more to ensure we had a good time.","2023":"They deserve a pay rise!","2024":":)","2025":"Thank you for making our day out so special!","2026":"Me and my partner visited the zoo for the full day and it was wonderful, we were really impressed with the enclosures especially the giraffe, sloth and penguins.","2027":"We had also booked a penguin magic moments which I can\u2019t express was the best experience ever!!","2028":"The staff were amazing, kind and really informative, I loved how we got to learn about  each penguin we fed including name and age which was wonderfulWe also dined at the gannet fish bar at the zoo and the food was great and came really quick!","2029":"And the portion sizes were also goodTo top it all off we went to the gift shop which had a great selection and once again the staff were lovelyOverall great experience at Edinburgh zoo, all the animals looked content and happy, the staff were beyond wonderful and the facilities were good!","2030":"WOW it was amazing.","2031":"The animals are very well looked after.","2032":"One of the best zoo i have been too.","2033":"Clean, nicely laid out.","2034":"Spoke to a couple of staff, One young lady who was feeding the river pigs was very nice and informative.","2035":"sorry didn't get her name.","2036":"We booked a directors tour and it was absolutely fantastic.","2037":"Every single keeper was friendly and approachable and all were knowledgeable.","2038":"We learned so much about conversation and research and how they care for each animal.","2039":"The director told us about plans for renovations so we will definitely be back in a few years to see them.","2040":"All the animals looked happy and healthy and we got to feed some of them which was an honour.","2041":"The grounds of the zoo were immaculately clean and tidy and the facilities and toilets the same.","2042":"David and Darren were fantastic guides and it was clear they both have a passion and care for what they do.","2043":"This was an amazing day out.","2044":"Thank you so much for making our visit so special","2045":"We are members who enjoyed our recent day-trip to Edinburgh Zoo.","2046":"As always we were glad to see the large variety of animals in modern and naturalistic enclosures.","2047":"Although Penguins Caf\u00e9 turned out to be closed for refurbishment (contractors were visibly working on-site), lunch at the Gannet Fish Bar provided large portions with quality ingredients.","2048":"Special thanks and a shout-out to Ranger Hannah who offered an interesting and up-to-date dinosaur talk followed by a pop-up tiger talk!","2049":"Very steep site, but some great animals and very friendly staff.","2050":"Saw giant pandas before they return to China later in 2023, meerkat, sun bears, koala, cassowary... plus many more.","2051":"Lovely day out","2052":"I visited the zoo on my birthday 10th of June and had a very good day.","2053":"When we got to the dinosaurs at the top of the hill we met discovery ranger Jamie and had a very educational tour of the Dyno land the facts and information was excellent, on the way back down we met Jamie again at the warty pigs and this was the 1st talk done on them and that too was very educational so all round had a wonderful experience that day.","2054":"Had the weekend in Edinburgh so we decided to get tickets for the Zoo.","2055":"10:30am slot to come any time after and we got there a little early as we thought the queue would be big","2056":"but we were only in the queue for At least ten minutes.","2057":"We were greeted by a lovely man at the desk and he asked if we had been before gave us some information and a little map and straight out into the Zoo.","2058":"The Zoo is lovely , very tidy and the workers are really friendly.","2059":"Some of the animals were either sleeping or hiding, that can\u2019t be helped but majority were visible.","2060":"We spent about 3 hours here.","2061":"I would really recommend this Zoo .","2062":"We will be back when our son is a bit older and understands more.","2063":"I used to live really close to the zoo when I was young and have been a lot of times, so I took my kids to relive the nostalgia.","2064":"We live in Australia now, and Australia Zoo is a million times better.","2065":"We were disappointed.","2066":"Most exhibits seemed derelict, overgrown with weeds, and no sign of life.","2067":"There was no sign to say if animals were not there.","2068":"It seemed like you were far away from a lot of animals, behind fences and thick weeds.","2069":"The dinosaur section was quite good, but the rest was just a long trudge with little reward.","2070":"The price is quite high for what you get, but it is a donation to the animals, not the shareholders.","2071":"Overpriced tickets.","2072":"Animals where either  not visible or their enclosures being fixed.","2073":"Food in cafe was not worth the money and cafe not very clean.","2074":"Came out of Grasslands cafe to be greeted by smoke and the stench of cigarettes as the designated smoking area is yards from the entrance to the cafe.","2075":"So day out for 2 adults and a baby cost nearly \u00a390!!!","2076":"The enclosures are beautiful and well planned for the animals.","2077":"There are lots of enrichments for the animals entertainment.","2078":"The zoo staff are AMAZING.","2079":"Easy to talk to and massively informative.","2080":"I thought food and drink prices were reasonable.","2081":"We spent 6 hours (and a bit!)","2082":"Here.","2083":"Absolutely loved it.","2084":"Amazing zoo with lots to see!","2085":"Animals seem very well looked after and happy.","2086":"Fun for all ages, but put on your walking shoes because it\u2019s very steep!!","2087":"Very, very disappointed in the Edinburgh Zoo.","2088":"We decided to go as we had never been before and heard good things.","2089":"We arrived and bought our (now seemingly very overpriced) tickets.","2090":"The staff member at the ticket desk wasn\u2019t very enthusiastic and did not make one mention of the Zoo being all up hill despite me being very visibly pregnant.","2091":"The visit started well with the lovely Meerkats, however from there, most of the animals were not out of their enclosures which was disappointing.","2092":"We walked all the way to the top, no assistance with mobility at all and no signage mentioning it.","2093":"We saw buggies for children for hire at the beginning for a hefty price, but nothing for adults.","2094":"Utterly exhausted and we get to the top to not be able to see most of the animals up there.","2095":"The Zoo also looked really rundown and not looked after and there were not many staff around.","2096":"The map given at the start was confusing and didn\u2019t seem to match up at some points and with no staff around, we had to just wander round or follow others to find our way.","2097":"The Zoo is marketed as family friendly, however the prices for ice creams and drinks were absolutely ridiculous, which meant we could buy nothing to help cool us down on as hot day after climbing all the way to the top.","2098":"All in all, I wouldn\u2019t recommend anyone go to the Edinburgh Zoo.","2099":"Got here about 11am with tickets pre booked.","2100":"Bus stop right outside which was mega handy and checking into the place was all easy enough.","2101":"You get given a map which we thought was helpful and the animals at this time we went were all mostly up and around to see!","2102":"Giraffes, sun bears and gibbons being our highlights \ud83e\udd70 we seen on reviews that the zoo was quite steep and difficult to walk up, for us it was not and one of us has just had major health problems.","2103":"The only steep bit is the very very top but other than that, with all the stopping and starting to look at the animals it was actually fine.","2104":"We didn\u2019t make use of the cafe or food \/ drink facilities but seen that there is plenty places to stop for a break.","2105":"We found all the animals great and staff really nice too.","2106":"The only thing we would say was that even with the map, the way the animals are laid out and all the different pathways it makes the map a wee bit hard to follow cause obviously you don\u2019t want to miss out any animals and we found that some of the signs were a bit misleading but this was just a minor issue and we made a point of getting to see everything, at first it was just a bit frustrating working out which ways to go.","2107":"We came here at 11, got a thorough look round all the animals and shop and left by 1:45.","2108":"We felt this was enough time but that was without eating in the cafes.","2109":"Overall, brilliant day out.","2110":"\ud83d\udc12\ud83d\udc3c\ud83e\udd92","2111":"The zoo is so run down and there are very few animals.","2112":"What animals are there feel like filler animals (goats, horses and birds).","2113":"The dinosaur display was also a huge disappointment, which was one of the reasons we came with 2 young boys.","2114":"We had also booked a slot (1-1:30) and arrived to find that the car park was full.","2115":"I understand they have limited space but I feel this should have been highlighted\/made clearer on their website when booking such a late spot so that we could have been more prepared with a plan b.","2116":"All in all I came away feeling hugely disappointed and disgusted that I had to pay \u00a365 for so few animals and it to be so run down.","2117":"(Wouldn\u2019t mind paying that if I felt it was being reinvested\/improving the animals conditions etc)Also can I point out they that they have 76 species (majority being birds, goats, horses).","2118":"2500 in numbers maybe (highly doubt) but NOT in variety.","2119":"Lovely zoo well maintained however,it is extremely steep to the larger animal enclosures and of course a steep gradient down.","2120":"For little ones, and those with mobility problems, would not recommend.","2121":"Rickety picnic tables and seats caused an accident.","2122":"Be careful!!Nice  to see the Pandas before returning to China later in the year.","2123":"We visited the zoo on a beautiful sunny Edinburgh day, which ultimately made the whole experience much more enjoyable, but we had a fabulous time here.","2124":"First in last out, we spent the whole day exploring and taking in everything the Zoo had to offer us.","2125":"From the majestic Pandas, roaring Lions, torpedolike Penguins, to sloths that choose a far slower pace of life.","2126":"Everything was fabulous.","2127":"Take some time to sit and enjoy the view from the hilltop viewpoint, best early or late in the day.","2128":"So underwhelmed and disappointed I excepted something really good as it\u2019s in Edinburgh but got a run of the mill over priced zoo I will not be recommending this place looks tired poorly keeped not much info on animals over priced food and drinks are shockingly high as for the ice cream","2129":"parlour well you daylight rip off \u00a32.95 for a feast feel sorry for the animals if it wasn\u2019t for the penguins having baby\u2019s it would have been a one star won\u2019t be returning and as for the hills you have to walk up omg","2130":"Never seen a real life panda before despite going to several zoos as a child and now an adult with my own young family.","2131":"Was a great experience.","2132":"A nice zoo, lots of walking up slopes and hills which we didn't mind but maybe hard for someone who struggles walking though.","2133":"Would definately revisit.","2134":"We went to this zoo with a 3 year old - it was an amazing and really enjoyable time-","2135":"we arrived at 10:30 and parked easily-  we queued for a few minutes only and then spent the entire day looking at the animals and playing on the play areas!","2136":"We were impressed by how spread out the zoo was though we certainly walked some miles!My grandson enjoyed the dinosaurs - what 3 year old doesn\u2019t!","2137":"A good family day out - well organised   Place to visit with young children - plenty of places to sit and picnic and toilets at regular intervals!","2138":"Been wanting to go here for a while, decided to go to see pandas before they return to China.","2139":"Very steep hills all around zoo,wouldn't recommend for pushchairs,small children.","2140":"Best animals were the penguin\ud83d\udc27 they had lots of babies, pandas were asleep.","2141":"Some animals we couldn't see in enclosures.","2142":"Wouldn't go again due to the steep hills.","2143":"From the moment we arrived we were welcomed warmly and looked after so well.","2144":"I was on a crutch due to a hip injury and was concerned about how hilly the walk up to the top of the zoo would be.","2145":"My fears were immediately dispelled when I was offered the use of the courtesy bus, which took us right to the top of the zoo to see the giraffe's and lions.","2146":"We were even given a special map showing how to avoid the steepest paths on the way down past the giant panda's, baboons, penguins etc.","2147":"During the bus journeys we were even given an insight to the animals we were passing and the breeding programmes, etc.","2148":"I would like to say a big thank you the lovely bus driver from Co.","2149":"Derry who added to this wonderful experience.","2150":"I would recommend a trip to this zoo to anyone, especially before the giant pandas have to return to China, as all the staff are so friendly and look after you so well.","2151":"Very steep hills but definitely worth the effort to get around.","2152":"Lots of information about the animals.","2153":"Only negative is a lack of waste bins","2154":"Had a great day at the zoo today.","2155":"You really have to have your walking boots on because the whole zoo is set on a rather large hill.","2156":"We had to go and see the Giant Pandas and they were beautiful","2157":"but apparently you have to be lucky because they like hiding, they are set towards the top of the hill near the dinosaur experience and not far from the Lions and Tigers.","2158":"The Koalas are a must see!Food wise I recommend the hut at the top of the resort near the dinosaurs, the food is great but it's rather pricey!","2159":"Visiting the zoo in Edinburgh was truly disappointing.","2160":"Right from the start, I was surprised by the lack of cash payment option.","2161":"It's highly impractical and inconvenient, especially for those who don't use credit cards or don't have them on hand.","2162":"The absence of such a basic payment option in a popular place like this is utterly incomprehensible.","2163":"Another issue was the limited operating hours of the restaurant, which closed at 3 p.m. Could they not extend the hours, especially during the summer season when the zoo is bustling with tourists?","2164":"It's highly inconvenient for visitors who would like to spend more time in the zoo and have a later meal.","2165":"Additionally, the green areas were in a deplorable state.","2166":"They were filled with weeds.","2167":"I would have expected the zoo to maintain the aesthetics of its grounds and provide a suitable environment for visitors.","2168":"Unfortunately, this part of the zoo was completely neglected.","2169":"Furthermore, many or even all interactive devices were not functioning properly, which were meant to provide additional entertainment and education for visitors.","2170":"This only worsened the experience, especially for families with children who expected interaction and learning opportunities.","2171":"I strongly discourage visiting this place, and I certainly would not visit it again.","2172":"The value for money is extremely poor.","2173":"There are too many inconveniences and deficiencies that hinder a fulfilling zoo experience.","2174":"There are other places that deserve our attention and offer far better attractions at a comparable price.","2175":"Our second trip to the zoo after first visiting in 2020 to tick the pandas off my bucket list.","2176":"On hearing of their return to China we had to come and see them one more time and wish them a sad yet fond farewell.","2177":"The zoo is lovely.","2178":"Seems so relaxed and not overcrowded.","2179":"I am sure it is busier at the weekends but a Friday was just perfect.","2180":"Lovely weather enhanced our visit and to see the pandas again was amazing but the other animals are just as good.","2181":"The penguins and their chicks\/eggs are fascinating to see and you are so close yet it doesn\u2019t bother them.","2182":"The tiger was my highlight.","2183":"Being a cat addict the pictures I got were ones I will treasure forever.","2184":"Ice creams and drinks usual for an attraction but everything goes to support the animals so it really doesn\u2019t matter.","2185":"I left with a panda in the zoo tartan which now takes pride of place in my bedroom as a constant reminder of such a lovely trip.","2186":"If we weren\u2019t 4.5Hours drive away we would be more frequent visitors but are 10 minutes from Chester Zoo so will support conservation and wildlife more locally with an annual trip back to Edinburgh.","2187":"Wonderful zoo in a great setting.","2188":"You wouldn't believe you were in a city.","2189":"It is however on a very steep hill so you need to be fit!","2190":"The highlight was the Giant Panda and the Koala's.","2191":"I loved them.","2192":"We visited Edinburgh zoo last week for my partner's birthday with our 4 and 2 year old.","2193":"Parking was easy (we visited during the week) and the staff at the reception were very friendly.","2194":"We have been before several years ago so knew it was hilly and had worn comfortable shoes in preparation.","2195":"My 4 year old managed to walk the whole day herself, only got carried during the last hour before home.","2196":"My 2 year old walked some good sections himself too as well as being carried.","2197":"We didn't use the mobility van collection service but knew this was available if we needed it.","2198":"Highlights for us were the sun bears, pygmy hippo, armadillos, giraffes and penguins who we got a really good look at and spotted them eating\/up and about etc.","2199":"Was great to see the penguins with their chicks and we chatted with a really knowledgeable and friendly member of staff about them (lady with blue hair, I didn't get her name).The kids absolutely loved the new dinosaur section at the top of the hill and this was a great added bonus to the day.","2200":"All toilets we used were very clean and had baby change facilities easily accessible.","2201":"A must visit place when you come to Edinburgh as a tourist!","2202":"Very friendly staff with detailed information provided upon arrival, and lots of animals and wildlife in the zoo as well.","2203":"I loved visiting the Zoo - this is the first time I've been since I was small, so I had a more memorable trip this time.","2204":"I loved seeing how the enclosures had fantastic enrichment to keep the animals physically and mentally stimulated throughout the day.","2205":"I wanted to visit the pandas for the last 11 years, and finally got to see them before they returned back to China.","2206":"The penguin exhibit and giraffe house are fabulous as they allow the animals to really express themselves naturally.","2207":"The wee silver (leucistic) penguin was a highlight.","2208":"I loved seeing the bintourongs, too - I hadn't realised quite how big they were.","2209":"The rhino and pygmy hippo houses were another highlight (I remember seeing the pygmy hippo on my childhood visit).","2210":"I\u2019m a regular at the zoo and have been a member now for a few years, I love my visits!I was gifted a half day keeper experience from my boss at Christmas and used it recently.","2211":"I had an amazing afternoon feeding the chimpanzees, enrichment with the meerkats, feeding Otis the adorable Ground Cuscus, feeding the armadillos and feeding one of the sloths also.","2212":"Thanks to Charlie for his patience, time and knowledge, he was fantastic.","2213":"For anyone thinking of doing this, go for it!","2214":"You will have a great time and will learn so much and overall a great experience being close to some of the zoos amazing residents.","2215":"Would love to do it all again!","2216":"Well where do I start !!","2217":"Wow\u2026 I\u2019m a lover of zoos and this place for me was absolutely incredible.","2218":"Tickets brought on line prior.","2219":"We had to queue to enter and the queue looked really long but within a few minutes we were at the front.","2220":"There\u2019s an option to hire buggies\/wheelchairs\/mobility scooters.","2221":"The zoo is all uphill except for when your coming back down obviously.","2222":"Every enclosure had multiple parts to it and every animal looked spoilt for choice space wise.","2223":"Highlights for me had to be the chimpanzees (one even laid a blanket out in the sun to lie on  ) the sloth (sleeping in his basket) and of course everyone\u2019s favourite the PANDAS.","2224":"Being a Saturday the zoo was extremely busy but Plenty of space for everyone.","2225":"Plenty of toilets dotted around along with food and drink stops and even 2 smoking areas (one up top by dinos and one just before penguin rock).","2226":"We even managed a glimpse of the new baby penguin born earlier in the week.","2227":"We caught the bus from Waverley station which was easy enough both ways.","2228":"Would I return yes","2229":"I would if only it wasn\u2019t 7.5 hours away from where I live.","2230":"Thank you for the most amazing day","2231":"The wife wanted to come to Edinburgh Zoo to see the Giant Pandas before they go back to China.","2232":"It is a small zoo but has a decent selection of animals decently housed.","2233":"Both the wife and I have mobility issues so I was a little concerned about how we would cope since the zoo is on a hillside.","2234":"However, the zoo has plenty of scooter, wheelchairs, etc for those who need them.","2235":"We took advantage of the complimentary minibus, which took us to the top of the zoo.","2236":"We were, then, able to work our way down at our own pace.","2237":"I recently came here with my partner and her child for a day out on the 1st of May 2023.","2238":"I had such a good time a Edinburgh zoo seeing all the animals from pandas to monkey and tigers the only downside is all the hills I will definitely return.","2239":"Verified closing time was 6pm.","2240":"Rushed 30 min drive thru traffic to get there for an end of day Edinburgh tour.","2241":"After paying \u00a310 to park we got to the entry at 5:02pm. Would NOT let us in !","2242":"Not even for a quick run around .","2243":"I was trying to give them my money and they turned it away.","2244":"I really don\u2019t think 58 min before closing is the correct time to shut out paying customers!","2245":"Have to give a 1 star because I can\u2019t get in to judge the other qualities.","2246":"My girlfriend and I came here and what a lovely Zoo it is.","2247":"As we first entered we were greeted by a staff member called Liam who was so friendly and pointed out all the animals we wanted to see, for us were the tigers and the pandas of course.","2248":"The whole zoo as a whole seems clean and animals seem to have enough space which is good to see.","2249":"My only issues I had were the penguins underwater enclosure seemed quite dirty and I would recommend some more big maps scattered around with \u2018you are here\u2019 drawn on them would help a lot.","2250":"My advice to tourists would be to wear comfy shoes as like others have mentioned it is on a hill so comfortable shoes is a must.","2251":"Overall we would return and to see the Pandas was amazing.","2252":"It would have been nice that if in the shop you have some animals with Edinburgh Zoo printed on the front as a memento however we did pick up two cute little pandas as a souvenir which was lovely.","2253":"When we returned Liam on the desk remember which animals we wanted to see and ensured we had a good time.","2254":"Thank you to all for making it a wonderful day \u263a\ufe0f\ud83d\udc3c","2255":"Booked a weekend in Edinburgh just to see the pandas!!","2256":"Weather wasn\u2019t great but what a lovely zoo!","2257":"Didn\u2019t realise the steep walks though!","2258":"Be prepared for lots of uphill walking so wear comfy shoes.","2259":"The koalas were so cute but the main attraction was even better!","2260":"Sadly, only saw the male panda though, the first day he was asleep but the next day caught him munching on his bamboo inside.","2261":"Big shout out to the guy in the shop (manager?) who saw me huffing and puffing over the huge queue of school children in the queue!","2262":"Only had 2 items so he let me through to another till!","2263":"Thank you!","2264":"Definitely recommend, maybe visit when the weather is better to see the pandas outside rather than through a window.","2265":"A lot of the animals seemed quite depressed.","2266":"Would be nice to hear about work being done to assess the mental well-being of animals at the zoo.","2267":"Or if they\u2019re contributing to research on animal welfare in captivity.","2268":"I know Newcastle University is doing stuff like this.","2269":"Excellent  lovely  from  start to finish  staff friendly   and it was  wonderful  would  go  again  well  worth  price  for  food  an entrance.","2270":"Recently went.","2271":"Its hilly just to warn some but not an issue for us.","2272":"We arrived with pre-booked tickets within our time slot which I would recommend.","2273":"As we arrived early it wasn't too busy and we went straight up to the giant pandas.","2274":"They are truly amazing and we saw them inside eating and also outside in their own spaces.","2275":"Really amazing to see them before they are returned to China.","2276":"Was really impressed with the rest of the zoo as well.","2277":"Loads and loads to see and only a couple of empty enclosures.","2278":"For me this is a really well run zoo and you can tell the staff take the time and effort to look after their animals.","2279":"That's all we can ask for and I do believe zoo's play an important part.","2280":"Penguins were fab to see and nesting at the moment so fun seeing the penguins walking round picking up stones for the nests.","2281":"It got busy as the day went on but nothing that was an issue with an enclosure.","2282":"Well worth a visit.","2283":"We came to visit the pandas this weekend before they unfortunately go back home to China.","2284":"It was our first visit to the zoo as we live in the south of England and from the moment we bought our ticket we were astounded by the staff.","2285":"The lovely man that served us saw that we had our Nan with us and offered us free transport to the top of the park so that she didn\u2019t have to walk up the steep hills.","2286":"This was unexpected and was a lovely thing to do.","2287":"The driver was kind and polite and even gave us a running commentary on all the animals we passed on the way to the top of the hill.","2288":"It is obvious from every staff member we spoke to along the way, that they are very proud of the zoo and care deeply for the animals and have so much knowledge about them.","2289":"All the enclosures are clean and viewing areas are placed so that it is easy to view the animals without too much obstruction.","2290":"It is up there with San Diego zoo as my favourite Zoo now!","2291":"If you are in Edinburgh it is a MUST!","2292":"It's been a while since we've been and were looking forward to it.","2293":"The kids had a good time but it's just aswell","2294":"they are little and can be entertained by the non animal related attractions as the visitor experience was quite poor.","2295":"I have no issue with how expensive it is to enter the zoo, I am more than willing to support the upkeep of the animals.","2296":"What I think could be better is more notification where enclosures are empty - there were many.","2297":"The only enclosure that had a member of staff available was at the pigmy hippo, no one seemed to be around to answer and questions or provide a little more of an educational experience.","2298":"Some indoor enclosures are so cramped that when it's busy you can't appreciate the animals as its like being on a conveyor belt.","2299":"I'd advise anyone to take their own food and snacks as it's incredibly expensive - think festival prices and I just don't know how some families afford it.","2300":"\u00a38 for 2 nuggets half a scoop of chips and a little carton of juice; \u00a34 for a hot chocolate served in a small cappuccino cup no extras...and that's just 2 examples of how insane pricing is.","2301":"Front of house in the restaurant near the penguins, wanted us to go elsewhere for a cup of tea, even after I explained they had no tables to sit at, I was told for 3 of us it was a table for 2 or nothing, the waitress then accidentally spilled my tea on the table and didn't even bring a napkin or cloth to wipe it.","2302":"The gift shop has all the usual things and in terms of price it's was expected, but the end sting was paying for parking, you really don't have a lot of choice if you're travelling by car but it just more cash.","2303":"For 1 adult and 2 under 12s I spent around \u00a3120 and I just feel that's really expensive for empty enclosures,  no staff presence and bare minimum refreshments.","2304":"We booked to come here on Easter Monday and had a fab day.","2305":"Arrived for 10am and got a parking space no trouble","2306":"but I expect the later you go the harder it is for a space.","2307":"It is a very hilly zoo which we didn\u2019t realise so decided to head to the top first and then work our way down.","2308":"Our 6 year old LOVED the dinosaurs ( we did too) who would have thought ?","2309":"Dinosaurs in a zoo \ud83d\ude09.","2310":"He said that was his fave bit.","2311":"We loved the giraffes and their encloser was great.","2312":"This was my fave part.","2313":"Headed to see the pandas but was very busy as we thought it would be.","2314":"We managed to get a glimpse but felt some people very selfish and would stand looking through the glass for ages and not let anyone else get to see the panda.","2315":"We found this a lot sadly.","2316":"We still had an amazing day.","2317":"We took a picnic and sat by the play park which was nice.","2318":"The zoo was very clean and all staff helpful.","2319":"Would definitely come back and recommend to friends and family if staying in Edinburgh.","2320":"Well worth a visit .","2321":"Visited mainly to see the pandas but was impressed by the rest of the zoo too.","2322":"We were able to get close to nesting penguins which I haven't experienced at other zoos.","2323":"The staff were friendly and approachable, happy to answer our questions and share their knowledge.","2324":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo, as we wanted to see the giant pandas before they return to China later this year.","2325":"Currently, there are no other pandas in the UK so this pair are rather special.","2326":"The zoo is situated a short bus ride away from the city centre, and has a frequent service.","2327":"Taxis were waiting outside for your return journey if required.","2328":"The zoo is on a steep hillside and the panda\u2019s enclosure was at the very top - we are not particularly fit, but frequent rests to observe the other animals meant we made it to the top without too much difficulty.","2329":"The zoo is clean and very well maintained.","2330":"The animals are well cared for, as far as we can tell.","2331":"There are lots of viewing spots so you can see different parts of the enclosures.","2332":"Apart from the pandas, we loved watching the penguins and the meerkats.","2333":"Visitor facilities are well maintained, we had a drink and snack at one of the cafes, although the seagulls were a nuisance as they tried to steal food from visitors.","2334":"In summary, a great visitor attraction which is well worth visiting!","2335":"This is a wonderful place.","2336":"The animals are in beautiful enclosures and they genuinely feel like happy animals.","2337":"The Giant Pandas are a must see before they go, provided us with so much entertainment.","2338":"The Penguins are absolutely hilarious - could have watched them all day.","2339":"The thing that made our day so special were the amazing staff.","2340":"Every single person was so friendly and helpful.","2341":"We enjoyed a panda talk with Hannah (?)","2342":"(Hope that was her name) and she spent ages after, talking to my daughter.","2343":"Really inspired her.","2344":"What an incredible team of staff and volunteers.","2345":"If I lived in Edinburgh, I\u2019d have an annual membership.","2346":"Thank you for a great day out.","2347":"My wife and I spent a lovely day in Edinburgh Zoo in April 2023.","2348":"The start to the day was a little unfortunate.","2349":"Near to the top of the hill, my mobility scooter gave up the ghost.","2350":"My wife went back to reception, and within just a few minutes a vehicle was dispatched to recover my scooter and provide me with a free wheelchair to use for the rest of the day.","2351":"The zoo is very hilly, but it is very well laid out, and easy to navigate.","2352":"We found that there were plenty of staff members around the park, and every one that we spoke to was knowledgeable, helpful, and very friendly.","2353":"We spent over six hours in the park, and had a great day out.","2354":"Despite living 400 miles away, this is a location that we will visit again.","2355":"In a world where service is not what we would like on occasions, we would like to thank the staff at Edinburgh Zoo, you are what make the experience better than elsewhere.","2356":"We had the best day here at the end of March.","2357":"We were lucky enough to see the Koalas and their babies and that made my year!","2358":"We made a special trip to see the Pandas before they left and it was well worth it.","2359":"All of the animals looked well cared for and some of the enclosures were massive.","2360":"Absolutely no concerns for animal welfare at all, unlike other zoos that I've visited.","2361":"Great gift shop too.","2362":"Next time we're in Scotland we'll definitely be back.","2363":"My partner and I love going to zoos and safari parks, and this one was no exception.","2364":"We spent so much time exploring the park and attending talks, such as the giant panda one, which were very informative.","2365":"We were disappointed that a few of the experiences were closed, such as the lemur walk through, but this didn\u2019t stop us from enjoying ourselves.","2366":"There\u2019s quite a lot of walking involved, so I would recommend setting the whole day aside for it (we managed about 6 hours there).","2367":"Definitely alot of fun for all ages, and make sure you take a visit before the giant pandas leave if you can!","2368":"Love this zoo and as a member I\u2019m a regular visitor ..","2369":"however I haven\u2019t been for 2 years \u2026 and wow what a difference .. and not at all good ..","2370":"what a dire place this now is.. the glass in all the enclosures is filthy .. there is no signage to say why things aren\u2019t on show or where they have been  we n moved to ..","2371":"it\u2019s clearly  now all about numbers\u2026 and putting money into plastic dinosaurs is deemed way more important than cleaning ..","2372":"I\u2019m not at all saying the animals  aren\u2019t  looked after ..","2373":"but I\u2019m talking about the visitor experience ..","2374":"Edinburgh used to be the market leader ..","2375":"it\u2019s not in the top 10 in the country now and that\u2019s a real shame ..","2376":"oh and the food and attitude of staff in the penguin cafe was shocking \u2026 I did speak to a manager and he took my thoughts on board and I can only hope .. that they will get better ..","2377":"they have too..","2378":"I value the membership I give .. and just now the experience was awful \u2026come on Edinburgh u can do so much better","2379":"The animals all looked comfortable, happy and well looked after but what made it for us was the staff.","2380":"They were all so friendly.","2381":"Our son struggles with mobility and they went above and beyond to make our day as easy as possible with the steep hills and distance you walk whilst there.","2382":"It was quite a spontaneous trip so hadn't arranged anything prior to going other than the tickets but nothing was too much trouble.","2383":"Every member of staff we encountered was lovely.","2384":"We visited 13\/4\/23, and understandably it was busy.","2385":"We queued to get in for about 30 minutes and the staff we encountered there were great.","2386":"Once we got in to the zoo itself though, things started to go downhill.","2387":"There are a lot of empty enclosures without any real info about why, and a lot of overgrown spaces that seemed to just be left to get out of control.","2388":"A lot of the animals weren't able to be seen, which is absolutely not the fault of the zoo if they just chose to stay inside, however there were a lot of obstructions such as overgrown plants etc in front of a lot of the windows in to the enclosures.","2389":"I'll give credit where it's due, the red panda enclosure and Penguin Rock were fantastic, and the volunteer we spoke to at the first red panda enclosure was lovely and knowledgeable.","2390":"One of the main issues I had, is how inaccessible the entire place is.","2391":"I saw there are sensory sacks to rent which is a brilliant idea, but then walking round (or wheelchairs\/scooters), a lot of the lower  windows were blocked off or too dirty to see through.","2392":"We didn't see a single keeper anywhere around the zoo, except one who was conducting an experience (and he was great), and the two in Living Links.","2393":"Which brings me to that area.","2394":"I understand the need for research, but the tiny cages the monkeys were in, and the fact that there are experiments on monkeys being carried out in a zoo shocked me.","2395":"I doubt I'd return if I'm honest, the above did put me off.","2396":"Another positive: The pandas seemed content, as did the koalas.","2397":"But overall, not a great day for us.","2398":"\u201cBen and Jerry\u201d are incredible - Rost serves quick and super tasty food made fresh and served with kindness.","2399":"Pulled pork, brisket, chicken - far nicer options than the usual foods found at attractions.","2400":"And they made my daughters day with the unique lunch request!","2401":"Thank you!","2402":"Lovely visit despite the climb up the hill.","2403":"Very tidy and friendly staff.","2404":"Daughter did the junior zoo keeper experience and had a brilliant time.","2405":"Lyndsay the keeper was excellent.","2406":"Great zoo , very hilly but loads to see , lucky enough to see the Pandas .","2407":"Easy to get to on public transport from the city .Clean, tidy, lots of staff and volunteers who are happy to answer questions.","2408":"Reasonable price food and drinks avaliable in the parkGreat family day out","2409":"After a long time.","2410":"We enjoyed a lot.","2411":"Having fun.and capturing random pics .","2412":"We enjoyed the walk.","2413":"Every thing i neat and clean","2414":"Absolutely loved it - no idea why people have written negative reviews??We loved the penguins who are clearly loving life based on all the eggs they are sat on!","2415":"Could\u2019ve watched their enclosure for hours.","2416":"Loved the amazing chimpanzee facility.","2417":"The pandas are gorgeous - we went straight there when we got in to avoid queues.","2418":"Beautiful views from everywhereYou can get so close to the giraffes if they come over!Loved the sun bears and watching them feed.","2419":"The keepers were all very friendly and helped point out the sloth and Abu other slightly more hidden animals!Great zoo - well done","2420":"Fair Price (considering the price of other zoos).The zoo is quite small but does have some main animals to see.","2421":"Lions, Monkeys, hippos, Giraffes, penguins.","2422":"The zoo is quite hilly (not suitable for people with mobility issues).The Dinosaur section is good with moving dinosaurs.","2423":"A few play parks for a break.","2424":"We never ate in any restersunts but did get some refreshments.","2425":"There wasn't a vast choice at the outdoor kiosks and the food prices we saw seem quite expensive.","2426":"The zoo did seem a little drab and dark at times and in need of some gardening, general tidy-up but the weather was wet.","2427":"Only criticism is they shut the giraffe house for a short spell to allow a private viewing.i appreciate that this was probably paid for and zoos need as much extra income as possible but it seemed a little unfair.","2428":"Overall it is a nice zoo","2429":"but we wouldn't rush back as we've seen it all.","2430":"Loved it here went as a family day out my 15 year daughter absolutely loved all the animals , great day out ,watching them make your own Ice cream was really good , good day for walking around sewing all the animals,  the pandas were so content and the Koala bears were adorable, plenty do with for kids of all ages .","2431":"Don\u2019t bother there are no animals.","2432":"Most the enclosures are empty.","2433":"Animals look sad.","2434":"There isn\u2019t much choice.","2435":"The worst zoo I have ever been to, they fill most of the enclosures with birds to make you feel you are looking at something.","2436":"Pigeons and crows are seen in plentiful.","2437":"Panda looks upset inside a little space.","2438":"Seen the pandas in Copenhagen and they have lovely outside areas with plentiful bamboo.","2439":"It's so fun!","2440":"If you travel with someone who struggles with mobility I recommend getting the shuttle to the top of the hill and walking down through the zoo as the steep slopes are quite inaccessible at times, but they're easier to walk down than they are to walk up.","2441":"Otherwise it's got so many animals to visit and plenty of places to have a break, grab a snack, sit and relax, or otherwise.","2442":"I absolutely loved it and found visiting the monkeys truly awesome.","2443":"I used the communication key by their enclosure to make friends with a monkey and get super up close, which will forever be a core memory.","2444":"Definitely visit whilst you're in Edinburgh.","2445":"Parking space is a nightmare.","2446":"It took me 45 minutes to find somewhere to park, too far from the zoo.","2447":"Tickets is expensive.","2448":"Considering the amount of visitors, they should do something about it.","2449":"Perhaps providing park and ride service would work.","2450":"Visited the zoo with my husband and two pre teen daughters and I have to say it did not disappoint.","2451":"We arrived at 10am (30 mins before our entry time) and was allowed to enter early.","2452":"Queuing time was minimal to enter and all the staff were very friendly when checking tickets or giving talks about the animals.","2453":"We visited on the first sunny day in a while and I think the animals loved the spring day as we saw all of them either having their breakfast or running around.","2454":"Highlights for us were the giant pandas and also the giraffes.","2455":"Only negative for me to mention is how steep the hills are to the top of the zoo.","2456":"I knew it would but climbing that hill felt like climbing Everest lol.","2457":"Just wanted to note as not an issue for us but might be if you have a buggy or wheelchair.","2458":"Spent 2.5 hours there in total and was enjoyed by all, would recommend.","2459":"When we got there as my son is in a wheelchair a very kind member of staff pointed us in the direction of the accessible entrance.","2460":"Staff were very pleasant.","2461":"Only thing they did not tell us about the mobility transport and we only realised after trying to push the wheelchair up the steep hill.","2462":"We had decided to give up at the penguin enclosure and my son stayed with my husband whilst myself and my grandson carried on to visit the giant Pandas which were amazing to see.","2463":"Highlights were the chimpanzees and the pandas .","2464":"Staff in the shop were lovely also","2465":"Nice and friendly, quite hilly but a good day out and the play parks were spread out well with a nice family food option of \u00a336 for all of us to eat (4) with a drink each.","2466":"Liked the overall size and layout of the zoo - not so big that there were miles to cover, but big enough to explore for a few hours.","2467":"Facilities were OK too.","2468":"Very few staff were on hand to answer questions around the park, once we were beyond the ones trying to sign you up for membership.","2469":"The chimpanzee building was particularly impressive, and the penguins were great fun to watch.","2470":"Considering what a big deal the zoo makes of the two pandas in its publicity, it really should have designed the enclosure to be more engaging to the public, with better viewing angles.","2471":"We could barely see through the glass due to the light reflecting on it, even close up, guarding our eyes.","2472":"The weather was overcast, nothing out of the ordinary.","2473":"It was the male panda, as seen on the webcam.","2474":"The pandas appear to have outdoor access, but if they don't choose to use it when you go, you may be disappointed by the view.","2475":"The female panda's house was closed off.","2476":"The animal's welfare comes first and I appreciate they may need to be closed off at any point, but it's disappointing that, even when they are supposed to be visible, the viewing angle has been so poorly designed that it's very hard to see.","2477":"Maybe a mesh screen or canopy a few yards back from the glass would help with the glare?","2478":"Not much time left now, though.","2479":"Not worth the queues that built up, sadly.","2480":"Again, if it weren't for the fact that the zoo makes so much of the fact the pandas are there, I may feel slightly less disappointed.","2481":"Came for a day out as my daughter wanted to come here for her 8th birthday and we had the most amazing day lots of animals to see the dinosaurs and also the parks.","2482":"we also went for lunch at the gannet fish bar which was amazing all came out fresh and really good size portions we can\u2019t wait to visit again soon\ud83d\ude00","2483":"Lots of healthy conservation efforts can be seen in practice as well as great animal husbandry.","2484":"Many animals kept themselves hidden away due to screaming children but closer to closing time it was much nicer to see them.","2485":"A very sad and poor experience with lots of walking looking at fences \/ structures but very few animals to be seen .Rhino enclosure sad and small they look so unhappy.","2486":"The shop structure is bigger than some of the animal enclosures what a disgrace .","2487":"What a ware of a 3 hour drive to come and be left disappointed.","2488":"We decided to bring our 18montj little boy for a day out to arrive and see hardly none of the animal sanctuarys open.","2489":"Place like a ghost town .","2490":"Nowhere to get a refreshment only at the exit.","2491":"Poor overall and a waste of time and money","2492":"We came specifically to see the pandas before they leave.","2493":"We were not disappointed.","2494":"The male spent a long time outside chomping on bamboo.","2495":"The keeper gave an interesting talk on them.","2496":"Also outside were the chimpanzees who were quite partial to parsnips.","2497":"It was surprising how many one could  collect to eat.","2498":"In fact it was an enjoyable experience to see all the animals at the zoo.","2499":"The keepers were very friendly.","2500":"The caf\u00e9 was good for snacks.","2501":"The only downside of the zoo is that it is situated on a hill.","2502":"Walking round was very tiring.","2503":"Fantastic morning walking the zoo top to bottom.","2504":"Animals well cared for, some lovely garden and also areas that felt left alone and like I was walking Corstophine Hill.","2505":"Great food at Gannets cafe.","2506":"Good info bout animals at each stop, friendly staff on arrival.","2507":"Very enjoyable..","2508":"Loads to see and do and seemed quiet but possibly how spaced it is!Be aware it's ALOT of walking and it's almost entirely uphill as you go around (apart from the way to the exit \ud83d\ude02)","2509":".Easily 3 hours and very worth it!","2510":"I truly enjoyed the visit to the Edinburgh Zoo.","2511":"In fact, one of the best as compared to other zoos I have patronized.","2512":"The set-up and layout of the Edinburgh Zoo is very well planned.","2513":"It does cater for both the young and Seniors to visit the zoo as the walking throughout can be very casual with the accommodating tracks leading to each enclosed caged animal to view.","2514":"One can set their own pace to view the landscape and animals.","2515":"More so, the viewing was able to get close to the animals without being harmed such as Rhinoceros, Giraffes, Tigers, Hippopotamus, Panda and Zebras to name a few.","2516":"There are also playgrounds to cater for children to have some fun and be entertained.","2517":"Indeed, a great sight and joy to watch these animals moving around or when they are being fed.","2518":"It covers quite a large landscape and along the way there are benches for resting and intermittent Restaurants and Cafe options.","2519":"There are also a lot of greenery such as trees and grasslands which gives a good feeling of the entire environment.","2520":"Overall, it provides a good family outing, especially with the good weather condition and cool temperature.","2521":"We (me and my pensioner aged Mum) visited the zoo on Sunday 5th March as part of a short break in Edinburgh.","2522":"We pre-booked a 10:30am arrival slot and arrived a little early but that wasn't a problem.","2523":"The entry procedure was quick and easy so off we went to explore.","2524":"Our main aim was to see the Koalas and their joeys, so we headed for there first, but took a little time to check out things we saw on the way.","2525":"The Koalas did not disappoint.","2526":"They are totally adorable!!","2527":"Well worth the trip from Yorkshire.","2528":"We saw pretty much most of the exhibits, except the ones at the very top of the zoo like the Giraffes because of the steep walk to get up there.","2529":"In fact I had to leave my Mum sat down on a seat overlooking one of the Tiger enclosures because she couldn't walk up any further.","2530":"I must admit even having been before I'd forgotten how steep it actually is!","2531":"Don't let this spoil a trip though, as there are plenty of places to sit and catch a rest while you make your way up, or for those not brave enough to take the walk there is courtesy mobility transport which you ring for if you need it (be sure to ask for the leaflet with the pick up points and telephone number on at the entry desk if you think you might be needing this).","2532":"The views as you explore up the slopes are pretty impressive, especially if like us you are lucky with the weather.","2533":"We also saw the Giant Panda before they leave, but getting a good photo was difficult as they were inside and there was a bad glare on the glass.","2534":"We ate in the Gannet fish restaurant and the meals were very nice, but maybe a tad expensive, but the portion of fish and chips my Mum had was more than enough for her.","2535":"I had the buttermilk chicken burger and chips and enjoyed it immensely.","2536":"Be aware when eating in this restaurant the ordering process is via an app you access via a smartphone and scanning a QR code on the table or menu, which takes you to the online menu to order.","2537":"If you can't manage the staff will help you.","2538":"Even me who had never really used such a thing before managed, and there's an option to add special instructions to the order if you need to adjust a menu item to your liking.","2539":"Following our meal we made our way back down the zoo checking out the likes of the penguins and the meerkats and ending up in the well stocked gift shop, where I purchased some postcards, fridge magnets and a gift for my friend.","2540":"The zoo is easily reached from Edinburgh centre and three different buses stop right outside (number 12, 26 or 31).","2541":"We were staying in the Haymarket area and we caught the bus right outside Haymarket station, but you can also pick the buses up on Princes Street in the city centre.","2542":"All in all it was a very enjoyable day out!!","2543":"Lovely zooSteeper than i anticipated legs feeling it today \ud83d\ude02Went to see the pands before they leave theyre adorable well worth the 4 hr drive","2544":"We came during a visit to Carlisle as we really wanted to see the giant panda.","2545":"We got there at 10am once it opened and spent the whole day here until 4pm.","2546":"The pandas and giraffes were the highlights.","2547":"Are at a sit down cafe for lunch and got amazing loaded fries- really good and large portions.","2548":"At the dinosaur area we were impressed by an enormous dinosaur by the picnic area and there were dinosaur themed food and drinks vans.","2549":"The facilities were very good although the zoo itself is quite hilly so those with prams\/pushchairs will get a workout!","2550":"Recommend getting there early as it got a lot busier during the course of the day.","2551":"We arrived at the zoo for my son's birthday to discover the car park was closed already so we found near by on street parking a short walk away.","2552":"After walking to the zoo we found out the car park was closed (with lots of vacant spaces) because of the mammoth que!!","2553":"40mins it taken to get in to a place that still makes you book time slots but state you can arrive any time after - doesn't make much sense.","2554":"Anyway when we finally got in we had a walk about to check out some animals before lunch.","2555":"We chose the fish and chips place which I don't remember seeing before.","2556":"Its prices were quite decent for a family meal and we ordered a takeaway....that my partner waited just over 1 hour for!!We went to see the pandas and it was lovely seeing them both awake however no nice seeing so many people battering the glass at them.","2557":"We moved on to see the koalas and understandable its popular with the new baby but after waiting in yet another que for 5mins that didn't move an inch our 3 young children had enough and we moved on.","2558":"To end the day we went to the gift shop for some treats and could barely move on the shop it was so crammed full of people (contradicts the \"covid safety measures\" of timed arrivals again) and you guessed it another massive que!We usually love a visit to the zoo but actually trying to get round the animals felt rushed as it still closes at 4 and nearly 2hours of our day was spent in long ques.","2559":"Came here with nephew last week although my nephew enjoyed it,  I'm on the fence with it because got told 3 different versions of events was hoping to hire a mobility scooter but was told by one member staff they gone in for maitince the previous day but there a mobility bus you can book and ring to collect you, it was quite but that's all well and good when it's busy only having one mobility van and waiting time is 10 minutes per time that's most of the day gone if queue is long, then when in the van I said to the member of staff when are the mobility scooters coming back as going to come in August she said they not gone of yet.then when buying my nephew a gift from the gift shop asked staff who served me if she knows when they going to be fixed said don't know if we going to bother getting them back, 3 different stories not good when you got disabled people needing these if I known this I would have hired one maybe train your staff better to get there stories straight the likely hood of me returning is very slim as I don't like being  miss lead","2560":"Returned after visit last year and one thing that always concerns me is breeding that goes on genuinely didn\u2019t think there was much going on until I returned this year I am unsure why they are breeding animals that aren\u2019t endangered and can\u2019t be released into the wild which only means they will be sold to other zoos or top up zoo stock for future visitors.","2561":"I always found a trip to the zoo helping rescued animals by paying submission but Edinburgh zoo is become darker over the years.","2562":"The monkeys being part of what they call ethical experiment taped up cage holes with divider shields doesn\u2019t scream ethical at all and today we witnessed 10+ monkeys running around in circles in experiment room","2563":"A and in B monkeys isolating themselves not moving much, watching this while people laughed was disgusting.","2564":"A lot has changed since my last years visit and honestly after what I saw today I am doubtful I will return i always saw a zoo as a refuge this zoo is more for amusement than education.","2565":"Stop breeding animals for stock and question the behaviour your monkeys are showing when you\u2019re not experimenting on them.","2566":"We visited for my 23rd birthday this year.","2567":"The zoo is brilliant.","2568":"I\u2019m a zoology student so often find some zoo visits ruined by noticing poor enclosure designs and stereotypical behaviours however this zoo is excellent!!","2569":"The enclosures are very well laid out and there are various little additions which make it that little bit better for the animals themselves.","2570":"It is upon a hillside so it does have that little bit extra to it, rather than just being laid out all in one big line.","2571":"The views from the zoo are breathtaking!!I was disappointed by the reptiles and inverts, I expected there to be more of them","2572":"but I gather that they\u2019re not everyone\u2019s cup of tea.","2573":"There are great transport links to and from the zoo and the city which I thought was great.","2574":"I love that the zoo operates webcams, as I can always virtually visit when I\u2019m missing it!The gift shop is very good too, and the staff very friendly and helpful.","2575":"We shall definitely be back!","2576":"Went to Edinburgh for a little break away and decided to visit the zoo on our last day.","2577":"It was good but felt like something was missing.","2578":"We did see the two lions but couldn\u2019t see the tiger or the moneys.","2579":"Really wish they had other animals there like Elephants or Rhinos (if they were there I didn\u2019t see them either) I\u2019m not too fussed about it costing \u00a340 plus pound for 2 people because I know the money will go towards helping the animals in some way but just felt like there was no atmosphere there.","2580":"It might be more lively and entertaining in the summer but less than 2 hours in the zoo was enough.","2581":"Feel like there needs to be animal experts dotted around telling us facts about the animals, etc","2582":"We got there at opening time and there was a substantial queue so I would suggest if you\u2019re going to go, go early.","2583":"The zoo is quite large and mostly onan incline so it would be a good idea to plan ahead with what you want to visit if your mobility is an issue.","2584":"The staff are fantastic and the animals look well looked after, we went in there at 10am, saw all the animals bar the Koalas and didn\u2019t get out until 15:30.Sensible footwear and drinks are a must.","2585":"Lovely zoo and def worth a visit.","2586":"Can be quite steep in places so a good shoe is def recommended.","2587":"Lots of refreshment stations dotted around and plenty of play areas for the kids.","2588":"Also loads of staff in hand to answer any questions about the animals.","2589":"Our favourites were the koalas (who had just had babies) and the pandas.","2590":"Shop also on site to get your cuddly toys and souvenirs","2591":"A lovely clean zoo, well signposted and nice play areas.","2592":"Very educational with fun facts about the animals.","2593":"Had a great afternoon at the zoo.","2594":"We actually hadn\u2019t planned on going but after a friend suggested it, we went.","2595":"Lots more animals than I\u2019d imagined and the squirrel monkeys were so cute and very fast.","2596":"They have talks and experiences you can join, so make sure you don\u2019t miss it looking at other animals.","2597":"Good day.","2598":"Took us 2 days and still missed some of the animals!","2599":"Took time to watch the animals & birds just doing their thing.","2600":"Zoo was very busy as it was school holidays so we did need to wait to get in but line moved quickly.","2601":"On the downside was leaving, utter mayhem trying to get out the bottle neck gift shop, really difficult for someone with issues around loads of people.","2602":"Asked if there was another way out but told no.","2603":"Big well done to the young man & woman on the mobility drive, you were fantastic & definitely under appreciated by some customers!Zoo overall is a fantastic day out, take a picnic though as food\/drinks are expensive!","2604":"Also wear the right gear for outdoor & walking!","2605":"Its very hilly!!Great day loved it!","2606":"Legs still hurt from all the walking","2607":"If I could rate a zero then I would.","2608":"Never before have I left a zoo and wanted to cry because the animals were kept and treated so poorly.","2609":"Moneys swinging from metal cage frames desperate to get out for so call \u2018research\u2019 whilst the zoologist carrying out the \u2018research\u2019 could clearly be seen on Facebook on a laptop open in the area.","2610":"At the panda enclosure there were signs all around  saying \u2018do not touch the glass\u2019 guests were pressed up against the glass banging on it and staff nowhere to be seen are we surprised these pandas are no breeding in such appalling conditions?The chimps had what I can only describe as rubbish in their enclosure Easter egg boxes, selection box rubbish as if it had blown from the dustbin and been left there.","2611":"Is this keeping with there natural habitats?","2612":"There was no enrichment being given to these natural inquisitive and beautiful animals.","2613":"All the enclosures were small and limiting for the animals.","2614":"This zoo cares more about the people paying to go than the animals that it is caring for.","2615":"Edinburgh zoo should be ashamed to called themselves a conservation zoo.","2616":"If you\u2019re looking for a zoo that actually cares about their animals go to Chester zoo.","2617":"It puts Edinburgh to shame.","2618":"Whilst inside the zoo I bought no food or drink or souvenirs because I will not fund this place.","2619":"We loved our visit to Edinburgh zoo even got to see the pandas out playing.","2620":"I got discount through work which for a family big five was a blessing as it was quite an expensive day","2621":"but it was worth it","2622":"Pre book online","2623":"and it saves you money on the entrance but you can only book for the following day so need to plan ahead.","2624":"Doing this can save you a 30 minute queue so it's well worth looking into.","2625":"We've been before quite a few years back so kind of knew what to expect.","2626":"The Zoo itself is on the side of a hill with enclosures and all kinds of other stuff dotted around.","2627":"It's steep up, and steep down but there are plenty of cross tracks and enclosures to look at on the way.","2628":"They have talks through the day (just like any other zoo) and are worth listening to.","2629":"There ate play areas all over for the kids.","2630":"The penguins have the biggest enclosure I've ever seen (I think I read somewhere the largest in Europe) but they didn't go for walkies when we were there.","2631":"Giant Pandas, big cats and a load of other stuff to see.","2632":"We never eat out at places like this so can't comment on any food issues.","2633":"Worth a go.","2634":"Really liked this zoo!","2635":"There was a good range of animals in nice enclosures, and there was lots of interesting information about conservation and rewilding in Scotland.","2636":"I\u2019d booked the \u2018Zookeeper for a day Experience\u2019 for my partner, but even as a guest I could still follow the experience around the zoo and take plenty of photographs from the public viewing areas.","2637":"Kirsty was our guide for the day, and not only was she extremely knowledgeable","2638":"but she had the most lovely and calming demeanour.","2639":"She put both myself and my partner at ease and volunteered plenty of times to take up close photos & videos with the animals.","2640":"As we walked round the zoo, you can tell how passionate Kirsty is through the stories she tells of all the animals.","2641":"She really made the whole experience extra special.","2642":"We fed Armadillos, a Tiger, Giraffes, Rhino\u2019s, Red Panda\u2019s, Meerkats and a special guest at the end (I won\u2019t ruin the surprise).It\u2019s definitely value for money, you get a snack token & a drink, and also a lunch token & a drink included in the price alongside a t-shirt and a certificate.","2643":"Overall a superb experience made even better by a brilliant guide in Kirsty.","2644":"Was a great day.","2645":"Didn't managed to see all the animals due to them not being out (understandable) but a great day nonetheless.","2646":"Felt like we had the park to ourselves with only a couple people around (went midweek).","2647":"Got some great views of the pandas, koalas and penguins.","2648":"They even had kangaroos which was a great surprise (most places have wallabies but not kangaroos!).Due to it being quiet only the main food places were open which was a bit disappointing but expected so not an issue.","2649":"Had a great day overall and would recommend.","2650":"This zoo is really nice.","2651":"The animals have very nice enclosures and are cared for very well.","2652":"The variety of the collection is nice.","2653":"There are a lot animals that Usually are not on display in the US.","2654":"They also have a hill with very good views.","2655":"They have the Scottish wild cat, giraffe and so much more.","2656":"The penguins are the best.","2657":"They have a great pool area and are so much fun to watch.","2658":"The zoo has some parking but the city bus stops right in front of it.","2659":"Stayed in Edinburgh 5 days had day tours everyday , saved the zoo til last, fantastic .Booked","2660":"my ticket before hearing about the pandas going back so that was lucky and they didn\u2019t disappoint.","2661":"Also they had koalas which I haven\u2019t seen in any zoo that I have been so far.","2662":"Quite a large zoo and yes on a hill!","2663":"A few different eatery places and lots for children to do..there were plenty of zoo staff walking around with the purple jackets on so if you needed any info on the animals or directions they were there to assist.","2664":"All in all a great day out!","2665":"Manythanks..","2666":"Most zoos are the same.","2667":"Edinburgh was the best zoo I\u2019ve been too.","2668":"The only downside  which can\u2019t be helped is it\u2019s on a huge hill, so make sure you\u2019ve got your walking shoes on!Wot.h going just for the pandas mind!!","2669":"Enjoyed visiting the zoo in Edinburgh.","2670":"All the animals looked well cared for and the staff are friendly and are happy to answer any questions, I loved watching the penguins in their enclosure.","2671":"I didn\u2019t eat here so cannot comment but for the price, I would recommend visiting, it was a lot bigger than I expected,","2672":"We loved every minute of it.","2673":"Visited in January as a birthday treat for our daughter.","2674":"Her favourite giant pandas were the highlight of our visit, but we enjoyed all the enclosures.","2675":"Penguins, chimpanzees, rhinos and koalas to name a few.","2676":"Very informative displays too.","2677":"We were fascinated with old enclosures dating down to when the zoo was first established.","2678":"Most of them out of use to accomodate animals' needs, but great to explore.","2679":"We will be back!","2680":"Spent many hours at the zoo today, enjoyed seeing all the animals on show despite the weather!","2681":"Got to see several animals being fed and enjoyed talking to the very friendly and helpful staff.","2682":"Particularly we spent 5-10mins with Isabell whilst feeding some monkeys, she was very knowledgeable about them all and was more than happy to answer our questions and chat!","2683":"We also spent some time with a member of staff with the giraffes who was more than happy to answer all of our questions and have a laugh with us too!","2684":"(Can\u2019t remember her name).","2685":"The animals and experience made this a great day for me.","2686":"But the staff were an absolute delight!","2687":"Got the 12 bus from our hotel and dropped us right outside the zoo.","2688":"Staff were helpful and friendly on arrival and gave us extra information about the koalas we wanted to see.","2689":"Quite hilly to walk around so wear appropriate footwear.","2690":"The main attraction for us was the Koala Territory- could have stayed there all day watching the mummy and joeys!","2691":"Volunteer in room was really knowledgeable and not intrusive - managed to get good photos and videos.","2692":"Saw a number of animals and got some interesting facts from one of the zoo keepers.","2693":"Had lunch in the penguin cafe.","2694":"Don\u2019t worry, not just fish on the menu!","2695":"A visit to Edinburgh zoo is great, and the Penguin cafe is fine for coffees and cake, but avoid the Gannet Fish restaurant at all costs.","2696":"The experience is appallingly bad - the food quality is terrible (I mean really terrible), the ordering experience is frustrating, staff need better training.","2697":"I could go on.","2698":"Eat before you go.","2699":"Buy a coffee and a cake at the Penguin Cafe.","2700":"But just don\u2019t go to the Gannet.","2701":"It will ruin what will otherwise be a great day out.","2702":"Overall a great day out, mo too busy which was a bonus, animall all seemed well looked after, keep up the good work!","2703":"Sarah (may have miss heard name) was lovely and really helpful when my nephew fell over and hurt himself, thank you!","2704":"The zoo was lovely seeing all the animals, a shame there wasn\u2019t the bus ride up the hill as it was a long trek to the top, suppose it helped burn some calories.","2705":"The restaurant we visited was lovely and the penguins were by far the best","2706":"This is a very nice little zoo where you can get to spend some time watching some amazing creatures.","2707":"We enjoyed the primates and the giraffes the most.","2708":"Was pretty cold as it was Scotland in December but lots of indoor viewing areas to get a quick heat.","2709":"Lots of hills when walking but I think this adds to the appeal of the zoo.","2710":"3hrs to 4hrs is probably enough in winter but would have spent a full day and used the parks in summer.","2711":"I fully understand the conservation of wildlife and how the zoo contributes to the welfare of animals.","2712":"I can only write how i felt after visiting the zoo.","2713":"Quite a few animals have inadequate space.","2714":"The chimpanzees enclosure seemed more like a prison for them.","2715":"The lions enclosure was small.","2716":"The tiger pictured paced up and down continously in front of us which i found distressing.","2717":"I have recently noticed previous visitors mentioning the same.","2718":"The zoo needs more space...more funding and alot of the animals we saw were alone.","2719":"It may be that they are solitary animals but the impression we got is that they are confined to a lifetime of imprisonment in confined spaces which are pretty boring for them.","2720":"There is so much open land in scotland why place a zoo in a city where its limited for expansion.","2721":"I would not visit again.","2722":"I left feeling sorry for these animals and i do not place any blame on keepers etc it just hits home hard where you have social breeds living in confinement.","2723":"Its no life for them.","2724":"I keepers will always look after the animals i have utmost faith in them I think the zoo needs major investment and movement away from its current location.","2725":"This is just my opinion and how i felt after visiting","2726":"The zoo is located about 20mins away from the Edinburgh City.","2727":"Accessible by Airlink100 to its doorstep.","2728":"There is a Holiday Inn hotel just outside the zoo","2729":"but it\u2019s not necessary to stay there unless you really wish to.","2730":"Admission fees apply.","2731":"It\u2019s cheaper to get it online at about 10% cheaper.","2732":"Online purchase of tickets will ask for the time to enter but it does not really matter.","2733":"The park is on a slope of a hill so it\u2019s a lot of climbing and it\u2019s steep.","2734":"While the park is generally accessibility friendly, it could be a challenge to push wheelchair up the slopes.","2735":"Prams are still ok as it\u2019s lightly in weight but can still be quite difficult if heavy.","2736":"Animals are mostly caged up although there are viewing areas where the animals can be seen roaming about in the open.","2737":"Winter is NOT a good time to visit as the animals are hibernating in their cages.","2738":"The food carts and stalls are also closed.","2739":"Quite a disappointment as it makes the experience less welcoming and enjoyable with no change to the ticket prices.","2740":"The park can be completed in about 2-3hrs excluding time for food.","2741":"The walkways are not entirely tarmac so the shoes can be dirtied and wet especially during rainy days.","2742":"Toilets are available throughout the park although it\u2019s suggested to visit one when you see it.","2743":"The friendly staff do make the experience better.","2744":"For Christmas I got a junior zookeeper experience day at Edinburgh Zoo as I love animals and one day I hope to become a zookeeper or a vet....","2745":"I went with my mum, dad and brother, and Kirsty the zookeeper looked after me, showing me how to feed the animals, telling me lots of facts about the animals I was taking care of, and she was lovely!","2746":"I recommend the zookeeper experience and would love to have a go at the adult one some day, as you get to feed tigers!!","2747":"(Jennifer, aged 11yrs, Scottish Borders)","2748":"We came to the zoo at the start of December and it was amazing.","2749":"We had not visited before and we had booked an Armadillo Encounter.","2750":"The lady at the main entrance, I think her name was Natasha was so lovely and really informative.","2751":"We spent the whole day around the park.","2752":"It was really quiet which was lovely.","2753":"The enclosures are designed with the needs of the animals in mind rather than making them easy to see everything or pretty for guests, which meant that we didn't see everything straight away but popped back a couple of times and saw everything we wanted to by the end of the day.","2754":"All of the animals seemed relaxed and has access to a private off show area which is definitely how it should be, the enclosures also replicated the natural environment for the animals as much as possible, with lots of enrichment around (and some very happy muddy rhinos)We had also booked an Armadillo Encounter which was amazing.","2755":"We were met by James who then also introduced us to Erica.","2756":"They were both so lovely passionate and easy to talk to.","2757":"We got the chance to make up some dinner for the Armadillos, and got to hold one and spend time with 2 species.","2758":"We walked away knowing a lot more about a species we didn't know much about and fell completely in love with them.","2759":"Thank you to everyone who made our experience so special, we will definitely be back :)","2760":"I went 25 years ago and remembered finding the stone pits and cramped cages depressing.","2761":"I went today with my 12 year old daughter who's been desperate to visit.","2762":"Goodness me, it was as bad as I remember.","2763":"The stone pits Vs the clinical new cages for the koalas and apes, it was a pure mishmash of russian cold war bear pits and a strange experimental science lab.","2764":"The tiger, pacing endlessly back and forth on a tiny shelf hovering over a steep pit.","2765":"The rhinos & flamingos were in so much mud it was heartbreaking to see them struggling to lift feet.","2766":"I wanted so much more from this zoo, where was the educational signage?","2767":"The lions were nowhere to be seen, we went back 3 times to their area.","2768":"Many cages empty, and although we were disappointed, it was hopefully to think they've been relocated to a wildlife park or somewhere like Chester zoo.","2769":"I don't doubt the staff care for the animals, but I can't imagine any animal lover not weeping at the sight of such depressed animals in filthy surroundings.","2770":"Teaching our youngsters about conservation is vital, but when there are so many impressive facilities (like Chester zoo for example), keeping this depressive old relic seems to be in complete contradiction of the zoos conservation statement.","2771":"I was so excited to visit this zoo as I'd heard so many good things!","2772":"Edinburgh Zoo is really fantastic and has some gorgeous and rare animals.","2773":"I thoroughly enjoyed the Panda and the Penguin talks.","2774":"Both members of staff who ran these talks were so knowledgeable, engaging and friendly.","2775":"I certainly learnt a lot!","2776":"I enjoyed being able to get up close to the wallabys!","2777":"They were adorable.","2778":"It was amazing to see the research team working with the monkeys.","2779":"This was fascinating to watch.","2780":"The zoo is on very steep ground but has benches up the way if you need them.","2781":"My only issue was that was we went in winter (assuming low season), the toilets were closed.","2782":"I had to walk back to the main entrance to use the facilities.","2783":"Came to see the panda and wasn\u2019t disappointed.","2784":"They go back to China in 2023","2785":"so you must go see them before they leave for good!All the enclosures are great.","2786":"Love the giraffes and to have 5 wow!","2787":"Penguins we\u2019re amazing too","2788":"Arrived at the zoo at 10:30am with 2 small children who said they were hungry, went to find somewhere in the park for breakfast found that nothing was open except the fish bar which was only selling drinks and cakes.","2789":"We made do with this thankfully they had some pastries.","2790":"We then made are way around the park finding that most inclosure looked far too small or were run down.","2791":"Unlike other zoos around the UK and abroad there was very little information or keepers giving talks.","2792":"Our visit was on a Saturday therefore the grassland restaurant should have been open however when lunchtime arrived the only place selling hot food was again the fish bar.","2793":"When we arrived it wasn\u2019t very busy however we were greeted by a manger (or appeared to be one) bluntly saying a minimum of 30 mins wait repeatedly as if to put us off (tbf had there been any other option to feed my children on site I would have left).","2794":"We ordered using the app which has more food options than the menu and also doesn\u2019t have things that the menu states, the app crashed whilst using it and didn\u2019t produce a order confirmation.","2795":"The food arrived quickly which was a good surprise.","2796":"We continued our tour of the park after this and then went home.","2797":"In summary the park is run down and badly managed.","2798":"For a capital city zoo excepted allot better, the zoo is in need of a great deal of money spent on it.","2799":"Such a shame.","2800":"To be honest the zoo is very dated looks very old.","2801":"It needs a bit of TLC.","2802":"The panda were great.","2803":"its a shame one of the entries was closed off so you couldnt see the other one.","2804":"Edinburgh Zoo needs to look at other big zoo around the UK to bring it to life.","2805":"The red panda was having a great time running up and down the trees it was loving life.","2806":"We booked my son Alex (8) in to the Junior Zoo Keeper experience for his birthday.","2807":"We were met by Kirsty who instantly made everyone smile and relax.","2808":"Kirsty was very knowledgeable and brilliant with Alex who talks loads and asks lots of questions.","2809":"The day was well worked out and we started off by visiting the porcupines and Alex got to feed them some sweet potato.","2810":"They were lovely and much bigger than expected.","2811":"We then went round to the pigs, who were very excited to hear Kirsty shake their food box.","2812":"After this Alex got to go inside the Crowned Lemur enclosure and feed and train them.","2813":"This I think was prob the highlight of the trip for Alex as he spoke about this a lot afterwards.","2814":"Kirsty also took my phone in so we could get some really good pics without the enclosure fence in the way.","2815":"Next we went to the Meerkats, Kirsty let Alex make some exciting games to hide live mealworms in, she also let his little brother Jack help with the making of the games.","2816":"Alex was then able to go in beside the meerkats and give them there games.","2817":"After this Kirsty took Alex round to see the 6 month old Armadillo called Wyatt.","2818":"He helped make up his good and got to climb in the enclosure and feed Wyatt.","2819":"Alex looked happy in here as he sat on the floor and fed and stroked Wyatt.","2820":"Lastly Kirsty took us to see a cuscus.","2821":"We weren\u2019t sure what this was but Kirsty said we would love him.","2822":"He did not disappoint, he was so cute and again Alex got to go in the enclosure and feed him.","2823":"See pic\u2019s attached.","2824":"Kirsty made sure Alex\u2019s hands were washed correctly between each enclosure and fresh gloves put on.","2825":"We also made sure to disinfect our welly boots going in and out of each enclosure.","2826":"Kirsty gave Alex a zookeeper experience t shirt which he we was very happy with and also a certificate for completing his zookeeper for a day.","2827":"Alex then got 10% discount in the gift shop where he picked a cuddly meerkat.","2828":"It was truly a great day had by all.","2829":"We booked this because Alex loves all animals, and also because it was, we thought not only a great birthday gift but also helps to give money to our local zoo.","2830":"It was \u00a3150 for the experience voucher.","2831":"Email communication around booking was easy and helpful.","2832":"Thank you so much Kirsty, it\u2019s clear","2833":"you know your stuff as your knowledge around all animals was impeccable.","2834":"Alex had a great birthday.","2835":"Will be back soon with the younger one.","2836":"Louise","2837":"The highlight was the park ranger Jamie who showed us the dinosaur tour.","2838":"Very informative.","2839":"We were lucky enough to have him all to ourselves so we're able to ask questions.","2840":"Would come again!","2841":"Absolutely amazing!","2842":"Kirsty was amazing and very knowledgeable about the giraffes.","2843":"Myself and my daughter aged 9 had a great time.","2844":"Top viewing platform was closed for the rest of our party to watch.","2845":"We can\u2019t wait for our next experience!","2846":"Thanks again Kirsty.","2847":"The main attraction here is definitely the pandas and they do not disappoint.","2848":"Definitely recommend visiting just","2849":"ti see them.","2850":"The rest if the zoo is quite good as well I really enjoyed the penguins.","2851":"Over all the zoo is a little run down and some areas could do with updating ( toilets etc).","2852":"Also be warned it is extremely hilly to walk around.","2853":"We visited the zoo on 25 October and as per requirements (not sure why necessary now) we had pre booked tickets\/slot.","2854":"We arrived in plenty of time for our slot only to find a massive queue going up the hill and round the car park.","2855":"Whole families with small upset children and many others who would cope with the zoo (but not an additional wait) were having to stand for around an hour before even getting in.","2856":"We in fact thought we would miss the slot.","2857":"If we had not already paid for the tickets (felt a little like being held to ransom) we would have left it.","2858":"I am a long time visitor to the zoo as used to come every week with my son when he was small and we loved it.","2859":"However this time I was sorely disappointed (not having been for a number of years).","2860":"So many areas looked in need of attention.","2861":"Many empty enclosures or areas clearly shut for Covid that have never reopened.","2862":"Many food concession stands shut and as a veggie there was a lack of items I could eat both in cafe and at the few open stands.","2863":"I rarely leave negative reviews as I know how hard people work and it is difficult times but unfortunately in this case I felt it is necessary.","2864":"Would not at this time recommend it.","2865":"Sorry to the staff.","2866":"A bit run down and in need of attention.","2867":"Quite a few animals not visible in their enclosures.","2868":"The staff were helpful and friendly and obviously love their jobs.","2869":"The Giant Pandas are the selling point but only one was there to see.","2870":"No explanations as to why.","2871":"Being members we have visited this zoo on many occasions and we absolutely love it As I have mobility issues one of the staff kindly took us to the top of the hill which is great The weather was horrendous but we made the best of it and were so pleased as we were able to say our goodbyes to the beautiful lionesses Roberta and her cub Mitaali who are moving on to pastures new","2872":"We were lucky enough to view the giraffes close up in their indoor enclosure and to warm up a bit whilst watching the antics of the armadillos and the sloth who was of course sleeping \ud83d\ude34","2873":"The penguins loved the rain but many of the animals were tucked up inside and who could blame them We have read a few negative comments about the zoo","2874":"but we find it such a privilege to see these beautiful creatures and to know they are happy and well cared for We can't praise the staff enough who are always happy to answer any questions Yes we didn't see many animals this time but we appreciate that they are not there purely for our entertainment and we look forward to visiting again soon \u2764","2875":"My husband and I had a half day Keeper experience today, and had an unbelievable afternoon with Kirsty meeting an amazing variety of animals from the gentle sloth to hungry rhinos!Kirsty was engaging and informative, supported us through each animal encounter and gave us background to each species and the work the zoo are doing to support them.","2876":"It was amazing to get so close to the animals.","2877":"Loved every minute of it, thanks to the team at Edinburgh zoo for such a wonderful day.","2878":"What a fantastic day out with the kids, they have their annual passes so will be visiting alot more throughout next year.","2879":"We always stop at the food truck up the top near the dinosaurs called r\u00f3st I believe its amazing really great food and plenty for your money.","2880":"We stayed on for the Halloween trail we all loved it and will certainly be doing it again next year.","2881":"Wow!","2882":"What a fantastic day we had.","2883":"Every member of the team we came into contact with went out of their way welcome and inform us.","2884":"We saw so many animals and enjoyed all of the facts and Interactive areas in and around the animals enclosures.","2885":"The  main reason for coming from Surrey was  to see the pandas and we were not disappointed.","2886":"Emma did our panda talk","2887":"and she really was brilliant, so entertaining and full of useful information for my panda obsessed daughter.","2888":"We also caught up with her again in the penguin enclosure and she chatted soMuch about the zoo and is clearly really passionate about the work the zoo does.","2889":"A really great  and interesting young lady.","2890":"We also met Alan in the koala  enclosure who too was so interesting and reallyKeen to share so much Information with us, a really lovely chap.","2891":"Thank you Edinburgh zoo you do a very good job and you have a wonderful team of staff.","2892":"I would highly recommend this zoo to anyone.","2893":"My son really enjoyed his zoo keeper experience.","2894":"It was definitely worth the money","2895":"and he got to interact and feed some amazing animals.","2896":"Although he wasn\u2019t keen on handling the fish to feed the penguins, Kirsty supported him with this and he was soon feeding them himself with a big smile on his face.","2897":"He wouldn\u2019t admit it at the time, but he did really enjoy being in with the penguins.","2898":"I must admit I was very jealous watching him.","2899":"Kirsty was fantastic with him and really knowledgable about the animals.","2900":"He learnt a lot.","2901":"We also enjoyed walking round the zoo in the morning prior to the experience and saw most of the animals.","2902":"My son is keen to go back to Edinburgh zoo and is already taking about another zoo keeper experience.","2903":"We visited Edinburgh specifically to visit the zoo as we really wanted to see the pandas.","2904":"You can easily catch a bus from Princes Street to the zoo.","2905":"We pre-booked tickets and did arrive to find a really long queue however it moved really quickly.","2906":"The zoo has really lovely grounds, particularly pretty in Autumn.","2907":"I was really impressed by the animal enclosures as I felt the animals had lots of space and stimulation.","2908":"We got a great view of the rhinos being fed and the lions were active and roared lots!","2909":"We went back to the pandas three times and were lucky that they were awake on our final visit.","2910":"It was amazing to see them!There are lots of places to eat at the zoo and we felt prices were reasonable.","2911":"It is hilly which was tough at times with a buggy but you\u2019ve got to expect this in Scotland.","2912":"We had a great day out!","2913":"So many different animals so see!!","2914":"Be prepared to walk up and down hills.","2915":"So good for a day out!","2916":"Memories made to last a lifetime","2917":"We have arrived 20 mins before our time slot to find a queue winding round for about a mile .","2918":"It is absolutely ridiculous !","2919":"100\u2019s of families , loads of children crying .","2920":"Looks like we will be in here for hours .","2921":"We have pre paid in advance so cannot walk away but other people are saying it\u2019s taking them 1 1\/2 hours to get to the front .","2922":"Absolutely absolutely ridiculous !","2923":"Will not recommend !","2924":"Enjoyed the penguins and the sloths, but that was about it.","2925":"The main advertised attractions like tiger and lion are virtually to see and the pandas, chimps and Sun bears were all just sleeping out of sight.","2926":"Fortunately it was a lovely day when we visited or it would have been a total waste of time.","2927":"Not a patch on the Highland Wildlife Park near Aviemore IMHO.","2928":"Love the zoo - been coming for years and today came for my son's 3rd birthday which he loved.","2929":"Have to mention the food at the Rost kiosk top of the hill near the dinosaurs-","2930":"oh my goodness the beef brisket was utterly amazing and the oregano sea salt fries were heaven!","2931":"Every single bite was delicious!The guy working at it was also super friendly.","2932":"Highly recommend!","2933":"Really enjoyable day out seeing all the animals.","2934":"They all seemed happy and well looked after.","2935":"The keepers were very happy to talk to us about them, which really made the day so much better.","2936":"Be prepared for a big hill, we were pre warned of this so took the buggy where otherwise I might have left it in the car.","2937":"Only thing that annoyed me slightly was having to pay for parking when I had already paid a fair amount for tickets to get in.","2938":"Worth every penny and spent a whole day here as there's plenty to see.","2939":"Comfy shoes are a must being on a hillside but it is well maintained with good size enclosures.","2940":"Seeing a panda was the highlight and it was clever to feed them outside so they can be seen.","2941":"Also enjoyed the many penguins including the underwater viewing area, the docile sloth having a sleep in their basket, the hippos enjoying the mud and the pelican sat on her nest.","2942":"Cheaper to buy a ticket in advance as we did.","2943":"Will go back one day","2944":"Our 2nd visit to Edinburgh Zoo,what a treat.","2945":"We brought our grandson here for his first visit to Scotland,one of the places top of the list was the zoo.","2946":"He loved it.","2947":"Saw all the animals,including the Pandas,Koala,Penguins,Lions.","2948":"We had lunch in the \"Gannet Fish Bar\",would definately reccomend eating here.","2949":"We all had Fish and Chips,the chips were the best I've ever tasted.","2950":"Amazing zoo can spend a good 5 hours hear easy!","2951":"Animals all have huge enclosures and look well cared for, been to alot of zoos and this 1 seems more well laid out and easy to follow on the map, steep hill up to the top so taken it slow, all staff were super friendly and knowledgeable had a great day out!","2952":"Definitely recommend buying tickets in advance as it was so busy with loads queued up and people were told if they hadn't got a pre paid ticket they probably wouldn't get in due to how many was waiting and you save money \u00a321.95 online \u00a324.50 on the day.","2953":"My daughter had the Junior Zookeeper Experience on Sunday morning and it was amazing!","2954":"She received this as a birthday gift in July, so had to wait a few months to get to the zoo, but it was definitely worth the wait.","2955":"The zookeeper, Kirsty, who was taking the experience was so friendly and really knowledgeable she was able to answer all the questions asked.","2956":"The experience was a combination of learning abut the animals, cleaning an enclosure, animal enrichment and feeding - she even got to hold an armadillo which was definately the highlight of the day for my daughter!","2957":"Would highly recommend this experience.","2958":"My daughter used her Christmas gift on Sunday The Junior Keeper experience and it was amazing.","2959":"My 9 year old daughter loved every minute.","2960":"Amazing price for everything we got to see and do.","2961":"5 different animals and lots of time with each feeding and learning about them.","2962":"Special Thanks to Kirsty our fantastic zoo keeper who was friendly and extremely knowledgeable.","2963":"Kirsty was amazing with the kids and knew all the animals names even all the penguins.","2964":"A fantastic role model for my future zoo keeper.","2965":"Would highly recommend.","2966":"Lovely day out and excellent gift.","2967":"We will definitely do it again","2968":"** A must do for anyone who loves animals!","2969":"**Just want to leave a review about the zoo keeper experience.","2970":"We purchased this for a Xmas gift and it was absolutely fantastic.","2971":"Our son loved every minute of it and ticked off everything we hoped for, and more.","2972":"Special thanks to Kirsty who delivered this, she is absolutely brilliant and made it a real treat for our son and made sure we enjoyed ourselves.","2973":"And clearly loves the animals.","2974":"We traveled up to Edinburgh zoo from Gloucestershire for my son\u2019s birthday as he is a fan of giant pandas.","2975":"And it did not disappoint, what a lovely Zoo with great friendly staff and happy animals.","2976":"Just be prepared for lots of walking and some steep slopes, but all very worth it.","2977":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo only two days ago and LOVED it!!It is a lovely zoo with some amazingly rare animals to see -there are Panda AND Koala bears that alone would make a visit worthwhile, however, I personally also especially loved the Pygmy Marmoset and Hippo!!The enclosures felt very animal friendly with lots of space to roam for the bigger ones and hiding places for when they don't feel like being exposed -it is not a circus after all!There were some research being carried out on monkey behaviour which visitors can get a glimpse of too which was very interesting.","2978":"And, staff were really friendly!Last but not least they had decorated the whole zoo for Halloween in a very fun way which was an extra treat.","2979":"Thanks for keeping up such a great place, we really enjoyed our stay and would love to come back in the future!","2980":"Simone x","2981":"I haven\u2019t visited in a long time and my memory was of a fantastic place.","2982":"Oh how I was disillusioned.","2983":"A lot of the cages and enclosures appeared empty.","2984":"Now, I realise that some animals are difficult to see, but our two children were bored when they couldn\u2019t see anything.","2985":"No elephants and no aquarium now was another disappointment.","2986":"The penguins saved the day with Bertie \u201cplaying\u201d with the kids.","2987":"Hardly any of the food outlets were open so we were glad we had the foresight to take snacks with us.","2988":"\u00a310 for two Cornettos and two small tubs of ice cream also seemed excessive given it is not cheap entry fees.","2989":"Absolutely amazing afternoon with zookeeper Kirsty.","2990":"So informative about all the animals we saw and more besides.","2991":"Even went out of her way to locate the penguin with the same name as my daughter.","2992":"Cannot recommend highly enough.","2993":"Absolutely brilliant day out, spent the whole day here the kids had a great day, so much to see lots of viewing points at each animal enclosure, decorated well for Halloween, lots of play parks for kids.","2994":"Cafe reasonably priced and good food.","2995":"I would highly recommend for people too visit, all animal enclosures are clean and look well kept","2996":"All the cafes and restaurants were closed yet the zoo was open and it was a really sunny day!","2997":"Terrible!","2998":"We went around and everything was closed.","2999":"The staff couldn\u2019t be less interested and the one place that was open only served hot drinks and chocolates.","3000":"Also it\u2019s 25 quid on the day and 20 online -","3001":"I still wouldn\u2019t bother -  the park looks big but they don\u2019t have many animals, they don\u2019t have much signs to even tellYou about the animals.","3002":"The place has steep hills, doesn\u2019t bother us but for families with prams might be difficult.","3003":"The park is old and dated and all the windows are so dirty.","3004":"You can\u2019t really see much.","3005":"One good thing is they have lockers which was great as we came here to kill a few hours before the airport!","3006":"But I wouldn\u2019t come here if I knew we couldn\u2019t what I know now, honestly spend your money on something else in Edinburgh!","3007":"You\u2019re not missing anything!","3008":"Or go to Amsterdam zoo, that\u2019s the best Zoo out there!I DO NOT recommend!","3009":"We had not been to the zoo in Edinburgh for about 25 years or so.","3010":"So when we had a chance for 1\/2 price tickets, we decided to go.","3011":"Much has changed and not for the better.","3012":"Lots of signs up about putting your trash in the correct bin, but hardly any animals on view and those were mainly the smaller ones.","3013":"We think we saw the mane of a lion but because of the position of the habitat, you couldn't really see much.","3014":"No sign of the much touted pandas or any of the other big animals.","3015":"(Disappointing after slogging up to the top of the hill.)","3016":"There were a few apes (chimps), outside, however on entering the building it was shockingly filthy in the enclosures.","3017":"My husband, who grew up in Edinburgh said \"it's an embarassment\".","3018":"There were some good points - if you had children - there was a very spacious play area.","3019":"The penguins were very good too and that is where we spent most of our time as they were quite entertaining.","3020":"The only large animal we really saw was the rhino.","3021":"I was really glad we did not pay full price, as even half price felt like a rip-off.","3022":"We are RZSS members so know Edinburgh Zoo provides excellent animal care in modern enclosures.","3023":"But this week we received truly exceptional service from staff.","3024":"At Reception we asked if there would be a keeper talk about gelada baboons.","3025":"Maddy told us none were scheduled but then took the time to contact the Ranger team to ask if one could be offered.","3026":"Even better, Ranger Rebecca then met us at the geladas and provided a lot of information about them (\"they are the only primate species left that is grass-eating, it is very unusual\").","3027":"She also patiently answered all our questions.","3028":"Later, at the kangaroo and wallaby walk-through, we spoke with Ranger Emma who told us about a number of recent arrivals at the Zoo: without her advice we would not have spotted the new crowned crane, the baby dik-dik (very cute!), and the pelican egg (on a nest, under a pelican).","3029":"And then just before leaving we had a short chat with Ranger Robert while admiring Fe the sloth (currently in a temporary enclosure).","3030":"Thank You to everyone for spending a lot of time with us and providing such a lovely day out.","3031":"And a small recommendation to Management: please post the schedule of keeper talks for the coming week.","3032":"Of course it would need to include a disclaimer such as \"Schedule subject to alteration as animals and staff may not be available at short notice.\"","3033":"But surely staff have the rota in advance and there are visitors--especially members!--who would like to plan their visit to attend particular talks.","3034":"My husband and I visited the zoo after our chum told us too.","3035":"The visit was fantasticWe saw the penguins, pandas, etc.","3036":"The greatest thing about this zoo is definitely Yang Guang and Tian Tian the giant pandas.","3037":"Both of them were fast asleep.","3038":"The gift shop was amazing with so many souvenirs.","3039":"Lots of wonderful staff.","3040":"The only negative is the property is so hilly.","3041":"We had a great visit.","3042":"Thanks","3043":"I bought the zoo keeper experience for my 11 yrs old daughter\u2019s  birthday and we both loved every minute if it.","3044":"Kirsty, the zoo keeper who accompanied and guided us, is very knowledgeable and nice.","3045":"We learned so many things about the animals we encountered and about Edinburgh zoo.","3046":"An amazing educational experience for children and adults alike.","3047":"Worth every penny!","3048":"My daughter did a junior zoo keeper experience and hasn\u2019t stopped talking about it since we left.","3049":"Kirsty was very knowledgable of the whole place, not just the animals that we seen.","3050":"Very organised, very fun for the kids, and interesting to see a behind the scenes glimpse","3051":"Well isn\u2019t this a lovely zoo to visit!","3052":"Me and my husband took a trip to Edinburgh for the day, and after friends recommended this zoo we knew we had to visit!","3053":"The best thing about this zoo is definitely Yang Guang and Tian Tian the only giant pandas in the UK!","3054":"Wow i never knew i loved giant pandas so much until i met these two, both fast asleep mind you but still fascinating to see, and listen to a presentation about them, which was very interesting especially when they showed us how small baby pandas are when born \u263a\ufe0f The sun bears were adorable and I must say i think all the enclosures are brilliant sizes and have been designed well to suit the animals environment.","3055":"Chimpanzee enclosures were very impressive.","3056":"Nothing was worn or broken in the enclosures.","3057":"Lots of lovely staff around pointing out the shy animals.","3058":"Toilets were nice and clean.","3059":"Must say we didn\u2019t eat here so can\u2019t comment on food.","3060":"I liked the website as is it easy to book the tickets online, but also as they have cameras in some animals enclosures including the giant pandas so take a peek while your on the website.","3061":"Only negative i would say is that it is very hilly so unfortunately my mum who has COPD wouldn\u2019t make it around here.","3062":"If you love animals like me and liked to be amazed by these stunning creatures then give this lovely zoo a visit.","3063":"As I said in the title, nice zoo but the gift shop!","3064":"The gift shop is overpriced for simple things like sweets, souvenirs (etc) I enjoyed the main bit of the zoo but it's the gift shop!","3065":"I will never set foot in there again!","3066":"I visited here with my partner October 2021 as we were in Edinburgh to celebrate my partners birthday.","3067":"It\u2019s a short taxi ride from the city centre and there\u2019s also a bus that takes you right by it.","3068":"We arrived and there was a bit of a queue but it went down quickly.","3069":"It wasn\u2019t too busy once inside so we got around to see the animals ok penguins were fun, we saw meerkats, rhinos, giraffes a curious otter and of course the pandas and much more.","3070":"We got a snack and drink at The Penguin Cafe, it\u2019s wasn\u2019t fully set up due to some covid restrictions still being in place but we got a seat, it was ok although things were over priced.","3071":"We had a good day out","3072":"We have just done the zoo keeper experience at Edinburgh Zoo.","3073":"We got it for last years Xmas for both daughters aged 11 & 9.","3074":"They really enjoyed it & kirsty the keeper who took us round was so knowledgeable & friendly.","3075":"We fed chimps, flew owls, made the armadillos tea, played with the meerkats & fed the penguins.","3076":"We made use of being able to go to the zoo for the full day too rather than just the times of the experience.","3077":"Totally recommended!","3078":"What a wonderful experience!","3079":"It was all we could have hoped for and more.","3080":"This was a gift for my wife's birthday and it was worth every penny.","3081":"From the moment we arrived we were treated so well.","3082":"Kirsty met us at the Keeper Experiences hut, and was very friendly and knowledgeable.","3083":"We had a lovely chat as we made our way to the rhino house, picking up a basket of treats on the way.","3084":"When we arrived at the rhino house, the boys (Qabid and Sanjay) were having a mud bath, but made their way over when they realised there was food available.","3085":"We had a great time feeding the two rhinos by hand while we asked questions and chatted.","3086":"Kirsty kindly volunteered to take some photographs of us, which turned out really well.","3087":"Afterwards, we could not stop smiling.","3088":"It was such a magical feeling to be up close with a pair of very large rhinos!The rest of the zoo was fantastic as always, and this was a day that will stay with us for a long time.","3089":"It was like it was closing down.","3090":"We visited all of the enclosures, saw 1 tiger, dozens of penguins, 1 giraffe, 2 pygmy pigs, 6 or so monkees, 2 wallabies and 2 kangaroos.","3091":"There must have been more there, and the 4 of us really looked.","3092":"Perhaps they were shy...Most of the food huts were closed, and there was more food in the shop on the way out, than there was in the only open cafe.","3093":"The ice cream seller only had strawberry...","3094":"The only good thing was the entrance service we got.","3095":"Chris needed a scooter, but there were non available, so they got a minivan, and a very interesting driver took us to the top, so that we could walk down the sometimes steep hill","3096":"Both of us were amazed at the size of this zoo.","3097":"Large enclosures, set on a big piece of land.","3098":"Most of the animals were outside, easy to view, so we were very happy.","3099":"Everything, including the staff seemed to be professional and run well.","3100":"I would recommend a visit if you have a spare afternoon.","3101":"It\u2019s on a hillside, close to the city.","3102":"There are approximately 80 acres on the site, so there is plenty to see.","3103":"A good selection of animals, the vast majority of which are endangered in the wild.","3104":"The zoo concentrates on conservation and the animals are well cared for.","3105":"There are a lot of uphill and downhill walkways, so it\u2019s not ideal for anyone with mobility issues, although they do everything within their power to make it as accessible as possible, although provision of more benches\/seats around the site would help.","3106":"What a brilliant day out!I\u2019d like to say this zoo shocked me !","3107":"I thought being in a city it would be a smaller zoo, but I was wrong it was huge! & so well looked after !","3108":"Obviously we mainly went for the panda\u2019s as we heard in 2023 they go back to China but we took our time around the whole zoo and loved it !","3109":"We saw everything all but one animal because all enclosures have many different viewing points not just one!Another thing i loved was the bin situation, where I live we just have recycling, and general waste but here you had food waste to and a list of what they wanted in recycling which to me is a step above quite alot of zoo\u2019s!Also the chimpanzee house - the research they are doing so amazing to see.","3110":"Word of advice, if you see the chimps outside still go in as live research could be being done and let me tell you not was amazing to see!***One warning: it\u2019s very hilly so if you struggle with hills be warned or take something to help if you have it.","3111":"Parking also costs \u00a33 which Edinburgh Zoo validates at the entrance if you take the parking ticket - which if like us you spend the whole day their, that ain\u2019t bad !","3112":"Bravo Edinburgh Zoo","3113":"I was very impressed.","3114":"Highly recommend","3115":"Quite disappointing really not a great deal to see animals were hiding or not in Plainview Tigers are okay wondering about aimlessly in a cage not great experience pretty smelly poo is coming from a lot of the enclosures not a very tidy place outside rubbish lying about bins overflowing with rubbish toilets was Not great.","3116":"Strange people wondering about.","3117":"We had different time from other places we visit we wanted to see famous Scotland wild cats but was very disappointed to see just one single cat.","3118":"For a place it says international breeding","3119":"According to some party be asked I was saying not a great deal of that going on you cannot breed with one cat.","3120":"Not got to see birds because of the bird flu situation in this country I think we should wait and see when it gets better to go back because it certainly was not good never saw very many things at all some ginger pig standing","3121":"and then quarter Not got to see birds because of the bird flu situation in this country I think we should wait and see when it gets better to go back because it certainly was not good never saw very many things at all some ginger pig standing in an enclosure.","3122":"I remember coming to the zoo when I was a young man although it is tired is it self up a bit since then it\u2019s still not great I\u2019ve seen a lot better elsewhere the very short of animals and the scatter them far and wide to make it look bigger when it\u2019s not I will see the animals are well enough looked after but there\u2019s not many of them I certainly wouldn\u2019t be going back in a hurry what I don\u2019t understand is how they breed with one animal","3123":"We had a brilliant zookeeper experience with Kirsty.","3124":"Our 8 year old had a great time getting up close to a fantastic range of animals and hasn\u2019t stopped talking about it since, some of which we had somehow missed in our years of going to Edinburgh Zoo, such as the exotic birds, armadillos and sloths.","3125":"Highly recommended!Generally, it\u2019s great to see the zoo thriving after covid, their food offering is much better and they\u2019ve managed to become a zero waste zoo.","3126":"We\u2019ll definitely be back.","3127":"We had a fantastic day out at the zoo.","3128":"Lots to see and interesting talks from the keepers who are very informative.","3129":"Managed to see pretty much all species there.","3130":"The only down side was the man serving in the Guraffe cafe was incredibly rude and lacking in customer service skills.","3131":"The rest of the staff were lovely.","3132":"What a lovely zoo.","3133":"We came for the pandas and penguins but came away happy and surprised by how many animals there were, in spacious and easy-to-view enclosures.","3134":"It was lovely to feel like the animals were well cared for above all.","3135":"We listened to a really interesting talk about the pandas and got to see the penguins being fed.","3136":"All in all, this is thoroughly worth a visit and we were delighted by all the other amenities available at the zoo itself, such as multiple restaurants, varied snack bars, many parks for children and water stations etc.","3137":"Admission prices to the zoo was \u00a321.95 which was worth it.","3138":"The zoo has parking shared with the adjacent hotel.","3139":"Fortunately when we visited, the parking was free.","3140":"There was a sign stating parking charges were to be reinstated on 1\/9\/22 but did not say the price.","3141":"The zoo itself was average.","3142":"A lot of animals weren\u2019t well visible.","3143":"The best part was seeing the giraffes.","3144":"We had an enjoyable day out at Edinburgh Zoo and would recommend it.","3145":"It is easy to get to from the city centre by bus and it wasn\u2019t too busy so we never felt crowded.","3146":"As others have mentioned, the hills are steep","3147":"so it\u2019s worth bearing this in mind and wearing appropriate footwear.","3148":"The penguins, giraffes and pandas were highlights and the dinosaurs are the top of the park are good fun.","3149":"It\u2019s a shame there is no official guidebook, as it would have been good to learn more about the history and architecture of the place.","3150":"We visited the zoo yesterday with two young children and all three of us had a wonderful time.","3151":"It\u2019s not your typical commercial zoo thankfully and it is clear money is being spent on conservation and research opposed to tarting up the zoo for commercial gain.","3152":"The animals were wonderful to see, we loved the tigers, giant panda and the red pandas.","3153":"We spent 6 entertaining hours there and would recommend it to others.","3154":"Thank you to the zoo keeper who gave such interesting information about the giant pandas.","3155":"Everyone one we spoke to at the zoo were kind and helpful.","3156":"Had a fantastic day at the zoo doing the half day  keepers experience and junior keepers experience with family.","3157":"Everyone loved getting close up, hands on and behind the scenes with the animals and learning so much about their care.","3158":"A real day to remember.","3159":"The hills are a workout and you do need the whole day to get round everything but we were there early and had a good look round beforehand and even got up to the top after the keeper experiences to see the dinosaurs.","3160":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo today and did the Junior Zoo Keepers Experience for my 9 year old boy, Elliot, as a Birthday present.","3161":"It was an absolute brilliant 3 hours.","3162":"We entered the zoo an hour before opening and met our zookeeper - Kirsty.","3163":"She was very knowledgeable, we couldn't believe how she could remember the names of so many animals!","3164":"We helped clean out and feed the Red Pandas, visited the Meerkats and fed them crickets, next was feeding the owl and armadillo and finally we visited and fed the penguins.","3165":"The experience was really excellent value and great fun.","3166":"Elliot was really engaged and Kirsty was an excellent host.","3167":"We were then able to spend the afternoon visiting all the other animals - and although the Giant Pandas were top of the list - there is so much more to see.","3168":"Thank you for such a great day!","3169":"We are looking forward to making another visit.","3170":"Our visit to the zoo was simply amazing as a whole","3171":"but I also booked the penguin magic moment as a birthday present for my girlfriend where we got to spend about 30 minutes feeding the penguins and she loved every second of it!Our keeper Kirsty was so great at explaining to us what to do and how to do it and how to act around the penguins so as not to scare them or hurt them.","3172":"She was also so knowledgeable and able to tell us all about each individual penguin!It is an experience neither of us will forget and I would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to get that little bit closer to the animals.","3173":"Superb zoo, loved it so much, be warned it\u2019s very steep.","3174":"Loved all the exhibits but the giraffe and penguins were my favourites.","3175":"We really enjoyed our day at Edinburgh zoo.","3176":"The map they give you is very helpful.","3177":"There were quite a few animals we have never seen before at other zoo's we have visited so that was a nice surprise.","3178":"The zoo is set in really nice surroundings with lots of places to sit.","3179":"It was very clean and all staff we spoke to were friendly and helpful.","3180":"Alot of the zoo is uphill so it was quite hard work for people with buggies especially double buggies!","3181":"It can be disappointing when you go and see an animal and they are asleep or not visible but when we went back later sometimes we were lucky and got a better view.","3182":"We would definitely visit again!","3183":"Had best experience with my family.","3184":"My little ones love it.","3185":"We love Scotland but this is our first time to visit Edinburgh Zoo.","3186":"Highly recommended.","3187":"My husband and I came for our 26th wedding anniversary, we love zoos, and we were staying in Edinburgh for a few days.","3188":"We were generally dissapointed, the enclosures are looking  tired and bare, I get its on a  massive hill, That was no issue really it just seemed to be big wide open spaces between animals.. not a lot to look at...","3189":"the highlight was the giraffes and penguins (one of whom yelled at me, I'm guessing as I didn't have any food lol but made me laugh) we called on at Penguin Cafe.. the guy behind the counter was rather rude, (he apologised when we pointed out)But the biggest shock was the toilets when we first got there...","3190":"we got there on opening, 10am, the tile for was covered in loo roll and none in the loo roll holder...","3191":"so they obviously hadn't been cleaned since the day before..","3192":"needles to say, I hovered...","3193":"Would I come again?","3194":"Probably not.","3195":"Would I recommend?","3196":"Probably not.","3197":"To end on a good note though, the Animals we did see were lovely and seemed happy...","3198":"so thank you for that.","3199":"Lovely zoo with exciting selection of animals.","3200":"Came especially to see Koala bears but also got to see other new animals for us like pandas, sun bear and king penguins.","3201":"Noted a good selection of things to hire such as mobility scooters and sensory bag.","3202":"Friendly staff.","3203":"Only niggle was the slide being out of use.","3204":"Haven\u2019t visited the zoo in years!","3205":"We couldn\u2019t help but feel like there was less animals in the zoo then the last time.","3206":"Although it was raining, we loved seeing the animals and would probably returnCost \u00a330 for 3 hotdogs and 3 iron brus!","3207":"Felt like daylight robbery","3208":"We had a fantastic visit to the Zoo.","3209":"There were so many animals to see.","3210":"The plan of the park was easy to follow and easy to see every animal there.","3211":"The Panda\u2019s were the main attraction and there were amazing to see!","3212":"The talks were very informative and the staff really knew their stuff!","3213":"My favourites were the Giraffe\u2019s and they were all friendly and forthcoming.","3214":"Definitely recommend a visit","3215":"Unkept pathways between animals , especially on the hill pathways .","3216":"The whole place needs re tarmacking to make it more suitable for disabled people.","3217":"The signage for animals whereabouts was few and far between .The keepers or guides were on short supply to ask directions.","3218":"When we did ask directions from one , he sent us in the wrong directionNeeds a lot of work on the people side of things","3219":"absolutely amazing place visited for the first time yesterday, The fact that the zoo has a koala & a Giant panda made us want to visit & they have two of each!Entry prices aren\u2019t bad at all for how amazing the place is!Car park - isn\u2019t a huge car park but plenty of spaces & also disabled spaces with closest access which is good.","3220":"Upon arrival The staff were very friendly & informative & answered questions also gave us a map & a disabled friendly map!","3221":"They also explained that their are mobility assist vehicles to help take you to the high points if you struggle with mobility (like me)","3222":"The zoo is very steep in places & i had to use the vehicle once to high parts very friendly driver & couldn\u2019t have managed without it, it\u2019s a great service that other places should do too!The animals are fantastic & we have visited many zoos & wildlife parks\/safari parks & one thing about Edinburgh zoo that stands out is the amount of space each animal has, lots of room almost like in the wild which is amazing & something we love to see!All clean enclosures & well cared for animals that look happy!The food from the food place not far from the penguins was very nice & tasty we had baguettes quality ingredients used but that is reflected in the price almost \u00a36 each but in my opinion worth it, drinks aren\u2019t too expensive but prices vary, the same cans of pop are cheaper in the shop at the start than they are at the shop by the dinosaurs (strange) but then again every staff member was friendly, other than the guy in the shop by the dinosaurs!Face painter was very friendly and skilled i must say patient & kind to the kids.","3223":"Lots of great photo opportunities so don\u2019t forget your cameras!Only thing i seemed to notice on a negative was we couldn\u2019t always find a bin nearby.","3224":"One of our favourite days out by far & thoroughly enjoyed by all 2 adults a 14 year old & a 8 year old.","3225":"Thankyou Edinburgh!","3226":"The zoo is great just not for the faint hearted as its built on a steep hillside so if you like hiking you would love it.","3227":"I felt like I'd do a Duke of Edinburgh Award in Mountaineering by the time we had finished.","3228":"We only went ti see certain animals that were not in other UK zoo's.","3229":"Beautiful views can be seen from various parts within the zoo.","3230":"The staff were helpful and very knowledgeable and were great to point put hiding animals like the Scottish wildcat at the base of a tree.","3231":"We didn't have any food or drink here as we brought our own so can't comment on how good it was.","3232":"The car park is best to get early as it soon fills up.","3233":"The zoo is easy to find by car it was our 1st time visiting and sat nav took us straight to the car park.","3234":"Well worth a visit for those less able you can hire motorised scooter if leaving a deposit, we saw a few elderly people taking advantage of those.","3235":"We visited today as a party of 4; two adults, a 6 year old and a baby.","3236":"We had a great day!There were plenty of animals to visit and some of our favourites were: the giraffes, the pandas, the rhinos, the sun bear and many more!My little boy loved the \u2018wee beasties\u2019 section.","3237":"We went along to a couple of the keeper talks which were interesting and informative.","3238":"Sadly, the monkey walkthrough and house was shut as they can catch Covid.","3239":"The penguin parade was cancelled because of avian flu.","3240":"Obviously this is due to keeping animals safe but could be reflected in a slightly lower entrance fee?I echo what others have said about the steepness.","3241":"Some areas were VERY tiring with a pushchair but we just took our time.","3242":"I can see why it can ruin people\u2019s day out, however, we did see the shuttle service dropping people at the top.","3243":"Plenty of places to rest and sit, lots of clean toilet facilities.","3244":"My little boy loved playing in the parks and had his face paintedDefinitely worth a visit when in the area!","3245":"It was brilliant to visit the panda\u2019s and all the other animals.","3246":"They all looked brilliant and well cared for.","3247":"There were lots of support for people with disabilities, although I had not checked to see the zoo is on a hill.","3248":"So for us lots of pushing the wheelchair up the hill.","3249":"The reason for not recording a higher classification, was that when we got drinks there was no soya milk, as well lots of the drink\/ food stands were either closed or started closing at 3pm.","3250":"On a really hot day, pushing a wheelchair it would have been great to get a drink, standard (non artisan) ice cream, but we had to wait until the gift shop for this.","3251":"Amazing zoo.","3252":"Yes it's on a hill.","3253":"Yes it's tiring to walk up, but the views and the animals at the top are bar none.","3254":"We go to a lot of zoos but I'm really impressed with this one.","3255":"It's currently the only place in the UK with giant pandas.","3256":"The enclosures are large, the animals look happy and well cared for.","3257":"There are members of staff everywhere - which I've not experienced in a zoo before.","3258":"There are videos at the panda enclosure in case you can't see them being active or if they're hidden, which is wonderful.","3259":"I'd recommend going early in the day, walk to the top first, then come back down.","3260":"There are dinosaurs at the top which move and make noise.","3261":"The koalas are another favourite with us.","3262":"The sun bears are great, though can hide.","3263":"Penguin area is the biggest I've ever seen, and there are lots of communities living together.","3264":"Fantastic to see.","3265":"Really really impressed with this zoo.","3266":"A beautiful zoo with lovely enclosures.","3267":"We watched the penguins steal rocks for an hour-so cute!","3268":"Walking right into the kangaroo enclosure was really cool-got to see a 4 month old Joey and chatted with their keeper for awhile.","3269":"The parking very limited, but we found a spot on a side street-be prepared if you don\u2019t reserve a spot first thing.","3270":"The gift shop was awesome but really busy!","3271":"And the zoo is on a hill, so bring water and be sure you are up for a hike!","3272":"I loved the zoo!!!!","3273":"The same as other reviewers- incredibly hilly although plenty of shade for a sunny day.i know it\u2019s a city zoo but some of the enclosures were very small and bare, they looked like they had never been updated since they were built years ago.","3274":"Most animals were inside as it was a hot day but you couldn\u2019t see them very well, maybe non reflecting glass would give better viewing.","3275":"The best enclosures were for the pandas and giraffes, the worst was one koala on its own in a small room with 4 bare tree trunks, bark chip floor and one bunch of leaves tied up and was quiet upsetting to see.","3276":"Will not return and would not recommend","3277":"Fantastic day out the only let down was the very rude staff member in the ice cream bit near the dinosaurs, I understand it\u2019s warm","3278":"but he was very rude to a few people .","3279":"All that said we loved the animals!","3280":"Decided to visit today as it was a hot day and would get us outdoors.","3281":"We were lucky enough to be the last car the get a space in the car park (12.45).","3282":"Entrance fee \u00a321.95 per person (adult).","3283":"Took the map as we are always getting lost on trails !!!","3284":"Anyway first stop the meerkats and off we went following the route that said keep to the right , lots of bio-diversity items and many animals etc including the pandas although they must have been tired with the heat as they were not very active.","3285":"Managed to find the giraffes, kangaroos, tortoise, rhino, etc but for the love of me we couldn\u2019t or maybe didn\u2019t find loins, tigers, bears, seals reptiles etc.","3286":"many empty paddocks and cages and even the penguin parade not currently in operation.","3287":"We had a pleasant day out but felt cheated as our recollection of previous visits were much more enjoyable.","3288":"Don\u2019t think we will return","3289":"Some what disappointing and food very very well done would I go again no would I recommend no would I give to the animals yes","3290":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo today!","3291":"With us was an expectant mum, we felt there should be something on your website (the word slopping) is a bit deceiving.","3292":"It was quite a challenge for her.","3293":"We were unable to get a ride to the top, there appeared only to be 2 vehicles at your disposal, maybe a ticket system or priority system would be better as when we were shown where to wait there were several families all stood about, chaotic would be the word I would use.","3294":"When 2 did turn up one of them went on a break, would not be a good idea for another driver to take over when drivers go on breaks.","3295":"Also toilets were very poor, no running water to wash our hands in one of them, at the top was just 7 port-a-loos and the were very dirty and no facilities to wash were not working.","3296":"In terms of animals we saw, giraffes were good \ud83d\udc4d tigers \ud83d\udc4d although it seems your advertisement is somewhat over exaggerated in terms of quality and standards for the animals.","3297":"Pandas we cool","3298":"but please clean there viewing  windows!!","3299":"Run down zoo with very few animals to See.","3300":"Many cages are just empty and in in a desolate condition.","3301":"For the price of 65\u00a3 for a family ticket I advice to Look for a different activity in Edinburgh.","3302":"Not the best zoo I\u2019m the world , just quite average.","3303":"A lot of empty exhibits, 90% of the interactive displays not working or in poor order.","3304":"A lot of the animal enclosures were dirty.","3305":"It\u2019s on a hill , a steep hill in places, some people may struggle.","3306":"It took 5 1\/2 hours to go around.","3307":"This was my first of trip to the zoo since the pandemic as my wife had a voucher bought from before the pandemic.","3308":"I have been to Edinburgh zoo many times of the year and have to say it's always a good day out.","3309":"If you have never been to the zoo before it is based on quite a steep hill with great views from the top.parking is right next to it.","3310":"I would recommend taking a picnic as there are plenty areas to have one and found the eating places very expensive and the service wasn't brilliant .","3311":"We had 2 coffees and 2 KitKat fingers and it cost \u00a39.60 which seemed quite high.","3312":"The highlights for us were the Giraffes to and the Penguins.","3313":"Like visiting any zoo it's your luck if animals are awake .","3314":"There is nothing they can do about the layout of the zoo because it is based where it is and have been at other zoos which are easier to see round","3315":"but they adapt pretty well.","3316":"Have previously left a 5 star review of my experience at Edinburgh Zoo and this is no different.","3317":"Except this time at the Zoo I got to participate in the Armadillos Magic Moment which was extraordinary.","3318":"Liz led the experience and was so knowledgeable - she shared many facts about the Armadillos and about the Chimpanzees (a favourite at the zoo).","3319":"My partner asked many questions and she knew the answer everytime.","3320":"The experience itself was so special.","3321":"We got to feed, pet, and hold the Armadillos and I was stunned the whole way through with the more we got to do.","3322":"We even got to prepare their food!","3323":"I had an incredible time throughout and left with so many new facts about the Zoo and the armadillo species.","3324":"I am already looking into doing another experience at the zoo.","3325":"Thank you to Liz for giving us great memories - I hope this feedback will be passed along.","3326":"I visited with my 2 young grandkids (7 and 4).","3327":"We arrived c9.30am - the car is large and free.","3328":"We joined the queue for the zoo opening at 10am.","3329":"Its probably worth arriving by 9.30am or c10.30am as the queue by 10am was huge.","3330":"The zoo is huge and pretty hilly in parts - its quite a climb to get to the top.","3331":"The animals all seem to be well looked after.","3332":"There is a large dinosaur park at the top, 3 or 4 areas for young kids to play scattered thru the zoo, plenty of eating options and lots of areas to have a picnic.","3333":"The food is priced about where i expected - we had sandwiches from The Penguin Cafe and a junior hot dog with a serving of fries from an adjacent van - the fries were actually very good.","3334":"Nowhere felt crowded - even at the enclosures with the big attractions (pandas, tigers, lions and penguins), though the car park was full as we left.","3335":"This showed how well-managed the zoo is to get so many visitors but not have anyone feel crowded.","3336":"Good variety of animals, delicious food, friendly staff, and cracking views.","3337":"Very hilly, which may make it difficult for those who struggle with mobility.","3338":"Signage could be better.","3339":"Few occasions it was difficult to find certain animal cages.","3340":"Attended for my birthday, as a treat to see the pandas in real life not just on PandaCam.","3341":"Loved seeing them close up and happy to see they have the ability to go outside and roam around.","3342":"All the animals have the ability to be inside or out in their enclosure.","3343":"The penguins, as somebody has previously mentioned on here, have a large area to roam and though the window wasn't gleaming - it doesn't stop them from enjoying their day.","3344":"Food available in cafes or outlets and toilets spread around.","3345":"We took our own drinks as it can get pricey constantly buying for everyone.  Plenty of space for picnics.","3346":"The zoo is hilly but plenty to explore and enjoy.","3347":"Will definitely go again.","3348":"Great place to visit.","3349":"The animal enclosures were all very spacious and natural.","3350":"Seeing panda's up close was amazing.","3351":"We bought chips from one of the vans, they were very nice and reasonably priced.","3352":"Car park closed as we arrived, saying it was full, and open when we left, travelled a fair distance and expected parking.","3353":"Had booked ticket, loved seeing the animals but space for them was shockingly small and the lion looked as though there was very little space for it too roam.","3354":"Makes you realise animals should roam free.","3355":"I have visited many zoo over the years and found them fun for family and kids also educational .","3356":"Edinburgh zoo seems run down and not very clean .","3357":"Lots  of the interactive things around zoo are weather worn or broken .","3358":"The glass veiwing window's were just filthy .","3359":"I understand these can be hard to get round in zoo but compared  to 3 sister's zoo we went not long ago  which had hand prints on them","3360":"but no where near the mess Edinburgh zoo were in  .","3361":"We went at half 10 in the morning and there was barely anyone there so these couldn't have been a days worth .","3362":"It's just felt sad being in the zoo with so little space for the animals .","3363":"So much blocked off that wasn't in use .","3364":"I feel the space the animals have just feels so small .","3365":"I feel it would be more beneficial to have less animals and more space for them .","3366":"I don't know think I'd go back to this zoo .","3367":"Overall the zoo is okay in that they obviously look after their animals, but as for the rest it leaves some room for improvement.- A water fountain or two might be an idea it\u2019s a big park and on hot days it could make a difference- Food is limited if you have any dietary requirements I\u2019m allergic to dairy and couldn\u2019t get an ice cream in a heatwave, I respect that was difficult circumstances.- Hire a window cleaner, the panes are filthy, so many greasy handprints on the glass we couldn\u2019t see through.","3368":"Went to the Zoo on 28th July 2022.","3369":"Family party of 4 adults & 3 children.","3370":"Lovely day out, bit disappointed on the number of empty enclosures.","3371":"Food stalls up near the dinosaur trail quite disappointing.- would love it if they could cater for dairy free diets (especially in the warmer weather).","3372":"All kids love an ice cream.","3373":"Kids loved their day out - kept very busy at the multiple on site play areas and spotting the animals.","3374":"The gift shop I found quite lacking, especially with the 'Edinburgh Zoo' branding - I couldn't find any stuffed animals that were easily identified as having been bought there.","3375":"( we purchased quiet a few things, that could be mistaken for being bought elsewhere).","3376":"Even the waterproof drawstring bag had no branding on it.","3377":"Overall 4\/5","3378":"Edinburgh Zoo is wonderful!","3379":"We took a bus ride from the city centre to the zoo as it added to the adventure.","3380":"We bought tickets online - I don't remember it being cheaper than paying there on the day.","3381":"There's so many fantastic sights - the penguins are brilliant, the zebras are gorgeous, the giraffe enclosure is amazing and of course, the giant panda which is made a huge deal of by the zoo is always good value.","3382":"Make sure you wear comfy shoes as the zoo is on a massive hill and definitely make time to watch the penguins have their dinner - its absolutely fab!","3383":"The zoo itself was the best, penguins had so much space to swim,nest etc.","3384":"Pandas were exceptional.","3385":"Lovely day out wished I lived nearer...","3386":"Pre booked a 10am entry time slot when the zoo opens and arrived early 9.40am and there were loads of spaces in the free car park.","3387":"Great final day trip while on holiday in Edinburgh.","3388":"Great value, kids loved it and a great range of animals.","3389":"They particularly liked the koala bears.","3390":"Had some chips from the Gannet and ice creams from outside the tent nearby all very nice.","3391":"Everything nicely priced and good value including gifts and food.","3392":"Only things to note is the zoo is on a big hill slope so walking up may be tricky for some people and the toilets on site could do with a revamp overall.","3393":"Overall we really loved our day out here and would recommend anyone to visit and support the animals here and the work they support around the world for endangered animals who need our help.","3394":"I've visited the zoo many times over the years since I was a child and my latest visit was yesterday with my 9 year old nephew and my mother in law.","3395":"When we arrived the car park was full so we had to park in a side street across the road.","3396":"When we got in the queue for tickets we found out that they were only accepting pre booked tickets.","3397":"Fortunately they had bookings available so we were able to book a slot online for mid-day which meant only a 15 minute wait.","3398":"Once we were in the zoo it was clear that they'd been doing a lot of work to improve the enclosures during the pandemic.","3399":"This is a benefit to both the animals and visitors.","3400":"Overall we enjoyed our visit.","3401":"We pre-booked our tickets as we was travailing along way, when we got to the zoo the car park is fulll signs was out","3402":"but there was a good amount of cars exiting the car park, unable to find parking close to the zoo we had to park down a side street and walk a distance to get in.","3403":"Once in The zoo it had a fair amount of animals, didn\u2019t feel it was set out very well as felt like we was waking a lot and also up hill which is different to other zoos I have been to, good amount of food\/ Icecream stops around the zoo.","3404":"If you take kids there is a good dinosaur part at the top and a good park as-well","3405":"Wonderful time at this zoom , one of the best in the UK.","3406":"Conversation efforts can be seen and they truly care for the welfare of their animals .Lovely range of animals and the information provided.","3407":"It really was very special to see Pandas so close and well worth visiting just for that reason alone.","3408":"I did enjoy seeing other animals too (only a few were hiding) and I could see they were cared for.","3409":"I also enjoyed seeing a Sloth for the first time.","3410":"happy in his comfy basket.","3411":"What wasnt so good, in my opinion, were the tatty fences in desperate need of a paint, dirty glass, unswept paths and uncared for garden areas.","3412":"Of course the animals should always be the top priority, but after that then money and elbow grease should go in to refreshing and cleaning up the landscape rather than spending money on the dInosaurs.","3413":"I think its just confusing for children to see dinosaur models in a zoo and not necessary.","3414":"The fish restaurant food was good, although eating there must be very expensive for most families.","3415":"We parked in a nearby road as car park full, but that was not a problem..","3416":"We enjoyed the exercise walking about and didnt mind the hills at all.","3417":"Great family day out with son and 3 grand kids.","3418":"Although the Zoo was very busy there was plenty of space for everyone.","3419":"Staff very friendly and accommodating, lots of seating and picnic areas, took our own picnic but plenty of places to buy food.","3420":"Was impressed with all areas of the Zoo - welfare of the animals, range of animals, information on the different species.","3421":"All in all an excellent day out.","3422":"If we knew this was on a mountain we would have got transportation.","3423":"It would be very interesting to see how high the altitude is form the top of the zoo to see if it marries up to the castle.","3424":"As far as the layout is concerned, not bad but no elephants (understandable but fans of these creatures will be unamused).The selection along with the advisors deserve credit but the terrain is emphatically not suitable for those without GCSE grade C in PE or above.","3425":"The gift shop could do with reorganising though as finding the tills in the mass sprawl that was the queueing system left a lot to be desired.","3426":"What a brilliant  zoo plenty if animals to see the pandas were fantastic as we're the kolar, very hilly in places make sure you have got walking shoes on maybe hard for people with prams wheelchairs and young children","3427":"The zookeeper was very knowledgeable and friendly.","3428":"She made me feel very involved in the process of feeding the meerkats.","3429":"You get to go inside the enclosure and if you are lucky the meerkats will come right up to your feet.","3430":"We visited at 27\/07And in my humble opinion i have seen allot of animals in distress like the tiger pacing  for a half hour its fair to say that you see allot of animals don\u2019t look happy it made me realize that a zoo is not of this era anymore Maybe  in the 70\u2019 and 80\u2019 it was amazing but unfortunately the animals in the zoo cant survive in nature i assume.the giraffes had the best facility far out","3431":"i hope they keep improving the other enclosure\u2019s alsoThe zoo also is on a steep incline some parts so when having a disability i assume its a hard days work walkingFood is quite expensive 2 kids portions chips  with 4 chicken nuggets and a falafel  wrap and was \u00a324 and not many healthy options also wish Edinburgh zoo all the best Maybe the review is not a good one but at least its honest","3432":"My partner and I had a lovely afternoon visiting the zoo.","3433":"We arrived around 1pm and it took us until 5pm to wander round and see everything.","3434":"The staff at the entrance were enthusiastic and friendly.","3435":"Some of the paths are very steep so can be hard work.","3436":"We would recommend going past the Przewalski\u2019s horses on the way up the hill as that way seemed less steep than past the pandas (would be nice if they mentioned that upon entry).The only negative we found was that all of the food places closed really early compared to the actual zoo (another thing they should mention when you enter).","3437":"No-one told us this","3438":"so we went hungry despite leaving one hour before the 6pm closing.","3439":"A great family outing.","3440":"We are members,  but appreciate the comments about the cost for non-members.","3441":"The hill is certainly a good workout - particularly with smaller people and pushchair!Members of staff were very helpful and nice and we enjoyed seeing all the animals!","3442":"Spent a lovely afternoon here with my daughter.","3443":"On arrival I asked about transport to the top of the zoo, and Liam, who was booking us in, went out of his way to book it for us,showing us where we could pick it up and suggesting we had a wander around the lower area, as we had to wait for about half an hour.","3444":"We saw almost all the animals in their areas, many more than we've seen on earlier visits.","3445":"All looked happy and content.","3446":"Not sure why others are calling it a rip off.","3447":"Enjoyed the dinosaurs up the top too.","3448":"Very clean surroundings, paths etc and all the staff we came across were friendly.","3449":"Not so keen on the restaurants on site.","3450":"Some of the food trucks further up looked good, unfortunately they were closing by the time we came across them.","3451":"Didn't spoil our visit though.","3452":"Thank you","3453":"A wonderful day out.","3454":"Visited on Sunday with my family.","3455":"A truly enjoyable visit from start to finish.","3456":"Staff at reception and throughout the Zoo are incredibly friendly and helpful.","3457":"Nothing was too much trouble.","3458":"My son who has Autism was with us and the Zoo is incredibly inclusive for those with additional needs.","3459":"A credit to the management and staff.","3460":"Enjoyed some ice cream from the ice cream roll stall - highly recommend.","3461":"A great day out!","3462":"Enjoyed the zoo.","3463":"Although the map and the arrows telling you where to go were a joke... Went with 15year old, 3,year old myself and dad...","3464":"If going by value for money it's not there atall..","3465":"Prices r crazy","3466":"I'm aware it's bn hard time for zoo.","3467":"No family ticket available for a start.","3468":"The layout makes it hard to get to see everything or rather to find everything.","3469":"Do not waste your money .","3470":"There are more rude staff than animals .","3471":"Its a joke am here only 1 hour so far ... a visit to pets store would be equal so far ... more reviews to follow  ...","3472":"We spent a whole day here as a family and our 9 year old loved the whole day.","3473":"We were lucky enough to have seen most of the animals.","3474":"You have to remember that these are wild animals who will only appear when they want and do what want.","3475":"The zoo is well signposted but is on a hill and some parts are quite steep but you are advised of this upon entry.","3476":"The keepers clearly care for the animals and are often around to answer any questions and provide useful information.","3477":"The keeper who was at the Giant Panda enclosure was very informative and spent several minutes answering questions.","3478":"My son did the armadillo experience.","3479":"Again the keeper was very knowledgeable and took the time to explain everything, answer questions and really involved my son.","3480":"It was great feeding the 2 month old hairy armadillo, Wyatt.","3481":"At the end of the experience it would have been nice for my son to receive a certificate or badge (or similar) to acknowledge his involvement in helping on the day.","3482":"Other zoos have done this.","3483":"Overall though a great day and highly recommended for animal lovers.","3484":"Would be back in a heart beat.","3485":"Over priced entrance charges (nearly \u00a350 for 2 adults) with very little to see in the way of animals, enclosure after enclosure with nothing in them, penguin march cancelled and a lack of general maintenance left our kids asking to go home half way through the day.","3486":"The zoo have tried to replace the lack of animals by turning it into a \u2018theme\u2019 park with dinosaurs, several parks and face painting at an additional charge.","3487":"We went as a family of 7 adults and 4 children and just feel totally ripped off.","3488":"The conditions the animals are kept in is a total disgrace, filthy enclosures, far too small for them with little in the way of children being able to interact with the animals.","3489":"We understand Edinburgh Zoo is all about animal conservation but zoos like this really need to be closed down as they\u2019re very much outdated and unethical in todays society.","3490":"For us the worst experience was the penguins enclosure, the viewing galleries were so filthy we couldn\u2019t see a thing!","3491":"Come on Edinburgh Zoo, get your act together and explain to the public exactly where our hard earned entrance fees are going cos it certainly doesn\u2019t look like the animals are seeing any of it","3492":"Edinburgh zoo is a great day out for all, animals seem week looked after & content which in the past wasn't always the case with some of the big cats especially seemingly bored in small enclosures so glad to see this has improved greatly.","3493":"Food is expensive but you come to expect that from such attractions so bring your own if you want to, plenty of places to sit & eat.","3494":"If kids are bored with animals there is several play parks for them to run around in.","3495":"Easy to get to with several buses available even if you live out with Edinburgh.","3496":"I really enjoyed my visit to the Edinburgh Zoo!","3497":"I haven't been to a zoo since I was young and I really enjoyed the experience.","3498":"There were many different kinds of animals to see, though some of them were a bit shy.","3499":"I imagine this was due to the unusual heat on the day I visited.","3500":"I even got to see some animals that I had never seen before in person (Red Pandas and Armadillos) which was truly amazing.","3501":"The only negative thing I have to say is that there weren't many animals in each enclosure and\/or they were difficult to see.","3502":"At the end of the day, I don't really hold that against the zoo since they have little control over the animals' behavior and habitat requirements and the priority should first and foremost be keeping the animals safe, happy, and healthy.","3503":"My daughter (aged 10) took part in the zookeeper experience today & absolutely loved every minute.","3504":"She had a great time learning about & helping to take care of\/feed the animals, particularly the penguins.","3505":"Special thanks to zookeeper Kirsty who looked after us & also gave us lots of information on the zoo itself, we will definitely be back.","3506":"NOT a Family Day anymore.","3507":"This was previously a wonderful zoo but it has turned in to an unloved place which has a very few animals on display.","3508":"Enclosures uncared for, external features uncared for, lots of empty overgrown enclosures, a distinct lack of animals.","3509":"It\u2019s just a zoo in a very sorry state.","3510":"Visited today with my 2 daughters and was absolutely disgusted at the lack of animals compared to a few years ago the zoo is severely run down over grown and definitely over priced,the viewing area for penguins in the pool was pointless as the glass obviously hasn't been cleaned in years,small monkeys in overgrown cages,apart from rhinos tiger giraffe and  pandas nothing else to see that you wouldn't see at a petting zoo definitely won't be back this place should be ashamed of themselves and certainly won't be recommending it to anyone","3511":"The zoo is decadent, very small places for big animals such as rhyno, tiger, giraffes.","3512":"Depressing place for pinguins and monkeys.","3513":"Tough path, completely uphill and hard for strollers, small kids and elderly people.","3514":"Run down and very disappointing.","3515":"Not the zoo I remember as a child.","3516":"Animal enclosures very poor and unkempt.","3517":"Sad to see.","3518":"I took my family there on the 11\/7\/22 and I was very disappointed I booked online and it asked me if I wanted to make a donation I clicked no","3519":"and it took the donation","3520":"anyway I was very disappointed way with the fact that most enclosures were empty and the ice creams were twice the price of the shops I really won\u2019t be back again I\u2019d rather to Blair Drummond safari so much better and more for the kids to do","3521":"Went to Edinburgh zoo with my young family.","3522":"We all have a Zoo membership and always have a great day here.","3523":"We usually take a packed lunch with us but decided to try one of the many options for food this time.","3524":"Choice of the day was Rost food and it did not disappoint.","3525":"Food was delicious \ud83d\ude0b Especially the buttermilk fried chicken burger which i had.","3526":"Customer service from the staff though was above and beyond.","3527":"Definitely would recommend to anybody looking for some lunchtime grub.","3528":"All in all a fantastic day had by all \ud83d\ude01","3529":"It's been a while since I've visited the zoo and with two teenagers, it could always be hit or miss ...","3530":"but we have had the best day here!We seen pretty much every animal, the highlights being the giraffes,  koalas and the boisterous chimpanzees!","3531":"The recent poor reviews are not a reflection at all on how well the zoo is set out and I guess some days the animals are more up for being spotted than others (which isn't really in the zoo's control!).","3532":"We got lucky today and really enjoyed walking around the many paths & enclosures.","3533":"\ud83d\ude0a","3534":"Worst zoo I have been to , any person  reading this I'd definitely  avoided unless you like looking at empty cages .","3535":"Best part was the penguins that's it , absolutely shocking for the price they charge .","3536":"An enjoyable few hours spent here.","3537":"A big focus on research at the zoo, which was very interesting.","3538":"At times a long distance between animals, as many habitats were being renovated.","3539":"Delicious rolled ice cream.","3540":"Be prepared for steep hills!","3541":"Took my two boys (15 & 7 ) along today for a little day out.","3542":"It was a good day out but not much had changed over the years!","3543":"The chimps looked depressed!","3544":"The glass for the underwater viewing for the penguin area is manky!","3545":"The bear looked bored pacing back and forth, over and over again.","3546":"I always said id never go back here but after having not visiting the place in over 10 years and my youngest has never been i thought surely the place would have upgraded alot!","3547":"how wrong was I. That will be the last time I visit.","3548":"Really enjoyed my visit to the zoo and seeing a variety of different species of animals that I have not seen in other zoo's and parks I've visted in the past.","3549":"I really enjoyed waling through the Wallaby area and taking some photos up close.","3550":"The staff at the zoo were very helpful and kind.","3551":"From front of desk to the keepers providing information of the animals I was interested in.","3552":"Just some constructive criticism for the zoo.","3553":"I would have liked to have seen more signs and information about the conservation efforts the zoo and the organisation does both nationally and internationally, as well as any projects the zoo\/organisation is carrying out.","3554":"Our whole family enjoyed our son\u2019s junior keeper experience.","3555":"Kirsty was absolutely fabulous, she was knowledgeable, kind and went above and beyond to accommodate a special request from him.","3556":"Absolute value for money, worth every penny.","3557":"Our son received this as a Christmas present and said it was worth the wait.","3558":"He had the best day and has left inspired to follow his dream to work with animals.","3559":"A magical day all round.","3560":"We\u2019ll be back to try one of the other experiences.","3561":"Thank you!","3562":"X","3563":"Had a lovely day with my mother and niece on the 8th July.","3564":"Arrived at 12:30 and stayed til closing at 6pm.","3565":"We were delighted to see all the animals at the zoo and stopped off at the Gannet Cafe for some fish and chips at 3:30.","3566":"The food was piping hot and delicious.","3567":"The cafe is very nicely decorated and laid out inside.","3568":"The staff were exceptional, I was embarrassed that we\u2019d arrived 10 mins after closing time for the cafe but the staff were lovely and allowed us in to eat.","3569":"After eating we then took another wander round the zoo again and got to see more of the animals who chose to come out later in the evening.","3570":"I was pleased to see how enriched the enclosures are and how happy the animals were.","3571":"The meerkats were especially active and enjoying the sunshine!A few enclosures were empty but signs stated that there will be refurbishments made and instructions on where to go to see the animals that would have been there.","3572":"I look forward to seeing when the works are done!The views from the hilltop and round the back of the giraffe enclosure are spectacular.","3573":"I often forget what a beautiful city I have right on my doorstep.","3574":"I was happy at the number of toilets around the zoo, as a sufferer of Crohn\u2019s it was a relief to not have to worry about how far the toilets were.","3575":"Towards closing time we entered the gift shop and I was immediately taken with the glass cabinet all lit up, displaying beautiful glassware with depictions of animals on them.","3576":"I bought two whiskey tumblers with a safari scene on from the shop and ordered another online as I was so pleased with the quality when I got home.","3577":"Also purchased were some fluffy keyrings, pens, stuffed teddy of the red panda and reusable bags with the zoo on the front.","3578":"All in all such a happy day and a wonderful visit.","3579":"I\u2019m hoping to save up to purchase a lifetime membership as I definitely want to visit more often.","3580":"Highly recommended.","3581":"We visited the zoo last week and had a really lovely day out.","3582":"When we arrived at about 10.40am the queue was very long but it moved quickly and we were in the grounds within 20 minutes.","3583":"We were pleased to see that the animals were actually visible, as we\u2019ve visited zoos in the past and several the enclosures appeared empty!","3584":"Highlights for us included the pandas and penguins.","3585":"First, a bit of backstory.","3586":"We were supposed to come to Edinburgh Zoo last year but unfortunately, my brother had caught Covid when we were planning to visit.","3587":"The zoo staff were very understanding of the situation and allowed us to keep the tickets for a year to visit again.","3588":"When we did choose our date to come here, we made an error with our date choice on the website and asked the team to move it to the Friday from the Thursday which they did; albeit with the ticket still showing as the Thursday.","3589":"The staff were really helpful in assuring me that all was well, I would like to give a shout out to Nikki, Emily, Jo and Liah of the Visitor Experience team for their help on this.","3590":"Now that I've waffled on about that, let's get to the experience of the zoo itself.","3591":"This zoo was very well maintained and the enclosures; particularly the monkey enclosures were massive.","3592":"Plenty of space for all the animals to move around.","3593":"I would say the three main highlights were the penguins, Giant Pandas and the koalas.","3594":"Giant Pandas and koalas are some of the most mystical animals I've seen in a zoo and you can really see how much work the staff put in to make the enclosures as close to how it would be in a natural habitat as they could.","3595":"The penguin enclosures really got the feeling of it being of what it would be for penguins in the Southern Ocean in fighting over one another to make their own nests as good as can be.","3596":"You could stay there for some time to take in what is going on.","3597":"All the animals were found on our list to find including the very elusive Red Panda and the iconic tiger.","3598":"There were also no cages used here, with the big cats, we have to go under the enclosure and see the tiger above us or near us in the enclosure.","3599":"The animals were all very happy and actively on the move all the time so you can tell the staff do a great job.","3600":"With it being built in the city, you really get the feeling that you're still in the countryside although you're actually in the city.","3601":"You really get drawn into the belief that you're in the countryside given how shady and how picturesque the zoo is and that's not an easy thing to do.","3602":"Though what stops this getting a five star are two issues.","3603":"Firstly is that the zoo is very poorly  signed.","3604":"This isn't a fault with the zoo itself, it's the fault of Edinburgh City Council.","3605":"There are no road signs for the zoo whatsoever until you are about a quarter of a mile away from.","3606":"And even when you get to entrance, the entrance sign isn't very clear, you have to look closely on the side of the road to find it so unless you know the area or have a satnav, you haven't got a chance of finding it.","3607":"The second issue is unfortunately to do with Edinburgh's geography, the zoo is built on a hill and some of the pathways are very steep to climb.","3608":"Those who have mobility issues or have shortness of breath will struggle to make it to the top of the zoo.","3609":"I think it could do with something like a land train or a funicular railway to take people from the bottom of the zoo to the top although I'm not sure these would work unfortunately.","3610":"Anyway, it was a great day out for me and my brothers and I really hope to visit again soon.","3611":"Keep up the good work.","3612":"If this were an Ofsted inspection the award would have been requires improvement.","3613":"A number of enclosures were empty, there were only one or two of each species in a number of cases - a large number of these proving to be elusive.","3614":"Whilst we appreciate the large swathes of weeds and wild flowers attract insects, there were a lot of sections that were dead or wilting.","3615":"The main restaurant was over priced for what we received - one meal was virtually cold.","3616":"The only plus points were the pandas, koalas and the singular tiger.","3617":"Attended the Zoo yesterday.","3618":"Unfortunately it was far too overcrowded with people with buggies who ignorantly blocked your views of the animals, although this is of no reflection of my ratings score as it\u2019s not the zoo\u2019s fault.","3619":"However, with reference to the zoo\u2026Unfortunately 9\/10 of the enclosures were either overgrown or the viewings angles were awful for the animals - you really need to look at restructuring and replacing viewing angles to maximise visitor\u2019s viewing experience as that\u2019s what we paid for at the end of the day.","3620":"Selection of cafe\u2019s and restaurants also terrible, why don\u2019t you have themed kiosks near the main attractions?","3621":"Everything too generic and not enough.","3622":"Also be aware a lot of areas restricted\/no access temporarily, the giraffe upstairs viewing platform was \u2018no access\u2019, why?","3623":"The excuse is that there\u2019s a \u2018revamp\u2019 being undertaken, however if you read the other reviews this has been going on for years.","3624":"If I had kids I\u2019d return, however the zoo needs a major facelift and modernising and increased viewing platform angles.","3625":"Brilliant \"After Hours\" at the Zoo.","3626":"Great atmosphere with live music, food and drink and a chance to see the animals in the evening.","3627":"Beautiful zoo in lovely grounds, plenty of animals to see, who all seemed happy and well looked after.","3628":"Junior zoo keeper afternoon for Dylan was fantastic.","3629":"He was buzzing after as he had such a good afternoon.","3630":"The keeper Kirsty who was looking after us was a terrific host and very knowledgeable when it came to the zoo and the animals.","3631":"She really is a huge asset to the zoo and can't speak highly enough about her.","3632":"We had the Armadillo, chimps, meerkat, red panda and the penguins.","3633":"Also had time to stop off at a couple of other places en route  while it was quitet.","3634":"Such a food experience and would recommend it to anyone looking for a present or reward or just a good day out.","3635":"Loved it.","3636":"Thanks kirsty.","3637":"Excellent day out.","3638":"Lots to see and explore.","3639":"Loads of fab animals in great environments and obviously well cared for.","3640":"Great choice of food stalls and picnic areas.","3641":"Staff were lovely, especially Frank on the gate.","3642":"What a nice chap!P.S.","3643":"It is quite hilly but it is Edinburgh!","3644":"We visited this week whilst on holiday in Northumberland, and loved it.","3645":"We\u2019re in our 60\u2019s and members of 2 other zoos, so visited Edinburgh on our Chester Zoo passes as a reciprocal visit.","3646":"I\u2019m a big giraffe fan, and was very impressed with their enclosure, it\u2019s the best I\u2019ve seen in any zoo.","3647":"We loved the giant pandas, koalas, and Pygmy hippos which were new to us, and ticks on our bucket list.","3648":"We were fascinated watching the research at the chimps, it was amazing.","3649":"We were a bit disappointed that the sloths were closed off, as were the lemurs.","3650":"We expected it to be steep, but were a bit shocked at how steep it actually was, we did manage it, but couldn\u2019t have gone round twice!","3651":"We had some of the loaded fries up near the dinosaurs, which we found to be expensive for what it was, and we were disappointed that we only found one place selling hot drinks, which was near the penguins.","3652":"We like to buy food and drink at places like this, to help out and do our bit, but I have to say I wasn\u2019t impressed with the choice.","3653":"Maybe we just didn\u2019t find the right places.","3654":"It certainly wouldn\u2019t put us off going again.","3655":"We loved the gift shop and spent a fortune in there on souvenirs and presents for our children and grandchildren, the personalised gifts are fantastic!","3656":"All the staff we encountered were friendlyWe will definitely be back next year!","3657":"Great day out for family.","3658":"Son (2yo) absolutely loved it.","3659":"We\u2019ve been to Edinburgh zoo quite a few times in previous years and have never been disappointed, lots to explore and plenty of lovely animals to see.","3660":"Completely unexpected this time was the food, which was epic!","3661":"Never been to a zoo with such good food.","3662":"Special mention to pizza from Pronto Pizza that was top notch, and rolled ice cream at rollys!","3663":"So nice to see independent food vendors, like a street food market in the middle of a zoo, what more could you ask for!","3664":"I spent a memorable morning one-to-one with friendly, knowledgeable keeper Kirsty for a \"Keeper Experience\", feeding, cleaning out and preparing enrichment for a super variety of animals.","3665":"Even better than I had hoped!","3666":"We have just rejoined as members here and love the zoo.","3667":"The addition of the giraffes is great.","3668":"Been to zoos all over the uk and Edinburgh being 20 mins from us is still the best.","3669":"Annual membership is great and gets you into Chester zoo and Highland Safari park too","3670":"I like the Edinburgh zoo.","3671":"Huge,cutes animals are there.","3672":"Staffs is nice,work hard for them.","3673":"Pingvins is my favourite one.","3674":"Amazing zoo!Really enjoyed our visit here.","3675":"Plenty of buses from city centre, so many animals to see.","3676":"Have visited many zoos and work in one myself and can honestly say I was wowed many times throughout my visit.","3677":"Entry price was reasonable, ate from the penguin cafe which again was reasonably priced and tasty.","3678":"Plenty of hill walking involved but the views from the top were stunning.","3679":"If I\u2019m ever in Edinburgh again I will definitely return and would recommend to anyone to visit as you will not be disappointed.","3680":"Fantastic day here.","3681":"Lots to do and see.","3682":"Large amount of stunning animals and the beautiful day helped us enjoy \ud83d\ude0a","3683":"Just finished the Junior Keeper Experience with Kirsty.","3684":"Whole morning was fantastic!","3685":"According to my son \u2018Nothing can top it!\u2019","3686":"He said everything was top of its class but he especially enjoyed feeding the penguins and owl flying.","3687":"Kirsty is really knowledgable instructor and he can\u2019t wait to do another experience again in the future!","3688":"We spent a whole day here on our trip to Edinburgh, it was really easy to reach by bus from the city centre!","3689":"There were lots of interesting animals and they were all really easy to spot which you don't get at a lot of other zoos.","3690":"I didn't eat myself but my friend enjoyed food from one of the burger vans in the centre of the zoo, and the other facilities (toilets etc) are everywhere!","3691":"The zoo is on quite a steep incline all the way to the top so I'd recommend sensible shoes and if you struggle with hills it might not be appropriate!","3692":"What a fabulous zoo!When I visited it was a gloriously sunny day, which helped!There were lots of animals to see, as you would expect, and all well sign posted, so its easy to navigate your way around.","3693":"It is built on a hill so there are some steepish  gradients, but also lots of benches to take 5 on.","3694":"It was clean and looks well maintained, and all the staff I spoke to were very friendly and helpful.","3695":"I took my own food and drink, so cant comment on the cafes.","3696":"All in all, a great day out for all ages, an a credit to the city of Edinburgh.","3697":"My daughter and I did the Zookeeper Experience at Edinburgh Zoo.","3698":"We had a wonderful time.","3699":"We met our zookeeper leader Kirsty and after some explanations on safety procedures we set off.","3700":"The first thing we did was feed the two rhinos which was amazing.","3701":"We then made interactive feeding games for the meerkats  which was a lot of fun.","3702":"We watched them trying to get to the mealworms we had hidden in cardboard tubes etc.","3703":"Great fun!","3704":"Next we visited the gibbons.","3705":"We didn't get up close and personal instead we went into their indoor room and hid some tasty vegetables under straw.","3706":"Again we watched them searching around, finding and eating nearly everything we had hidden.","3707":"We then met a one-eyed tawny owl who flew onto my arm where it claimed its prize of a little mouse head.","3708":"Lastly we couldn't leave Edinburgh Zoo without a visit to the famous penguin enclosure where we hand fed the penguins.","3709":"Kirsty was marvellous and so informative.","3710":"What a lovely sunny unforgettable afternoon it was!","3711":"The zoo had everything you could think of and the panda\u2019s were amazing to see.","3712":"Everything was laid out really well and had plenty of rest areas with food kiosks and the restaurant was really nice too.","3713":"Staff there were extremely friendly.","3714":"To be honest, we only booked tickets because of the pandas.","3715":"However, we were blown away by the amount of animals and the size of the zoo.","3716":"We were extremely pleasantly surprised.","3717":"We saw kangaroos, wallabies, koalas, sloths, red pandas, giraffes, lions, many types of monkeys, birds, etc.","3718":"The penguins even received a royal visit by Princess Anne.","3719":"We had a great time with our teenage children.","3720":"The zoo has a lovely shop but we also discovered that later we were able to purchase other items that were out of stock the day we visited.","3721":"The online order gave us a 10% off voucher, too.","3722":"It was a great day out during our stay in Edinburgh.","3723":"We can highly recommend it","3724":"Our first time to the zoo and there were lots of animals to see...","3725":"Thought the enclosures were nice and big for the animals too \ud83d\udc4d","3726":"the staff were very friendly too a great place to visit even if it gets a little steep at the top gives you a good work out...","3727":"Loved the penguin area..","3728":"Huge...","3729":"I booked a sloth Magic moments experience and well it was one of the best decisions ever!Our keeper was fantastic and so knowledgeable and truly made the experience so special.","3730":"Feeding the sloths and getting to see them up close was amazing and our keeper was great with taking photos and videos for us to remember this by.","3731":"It was also great that my partner was allowed into the area to watch too which meant that he got a small taste of the experience as well rather than being made to wait outside, which I feel is what alot of places would have done.","3732":"We had a lovely day which was definitely helped by the weather, saw everything we wanted to see and would definitely reccomend.","3733":"Not all the animals were out and about but that is the nature of animals and I think sometimes people forget that.","3734":"Came here on Saturday for the day and really enjoyed my visit.","3735":"Booked tickets online that morning, and although it was a sunny bank holiday weekend, there was plenty of availability.","3736":"There is a good variety of animals and they all look well cared for.","3737":"Plenty of places to get food and refreshments.","3738":"There are a fair few big slopes to walk up (they do make mention of this on their website) so just be mindful of this if anyone in your group has disabilities.","3739":"Was really cool to see the pandas and baby penguins.","3740":"Overall, had a really good visit and would go back.","3741":"We called today,It's looked the same for years and definitely needs updating.","3742":"The penguin cafe was disgraceful, rubbish all over the tables and floors.","3743":"We had to clean it ourselves which was not a problem but there was staff lingering around.","3744":"It's a shame considering it's a beautiful place but definitely needs help.","3745":"So sorry to complain, but sometimes opinions can make a difference..","3746":"Took my 14 year old son yesterday, the weather was good so made the day a good one.","3747":"It\u2019s been a few years since I\u2019ve been to the zoo ( about ten).","3748":"A lot of the  property looks tired and in need to some TLC.","3749":"Like wise I felt many of the enclosures for the animals looked the same.","3750":"Couldn\u2019t help feel sorry for a few monkeys who seemed housed in an old area of the zoo away from bigger more modern enclosures.","3751":"It looked like they had been forgotten in the move!Maybe there for a reason but no signage to say so.","3752":"I live quite near the Yorkshire Wildlife Park which is on s completely different level to this zoo.","3753":"Whilst the zoo holds happy childhood memories for me now my son has been don\u2019t think I\u2019ll return any time soonOh also  worth a mention those with children consider taking a picnic.","3754":"Plenty of space to do so.","3755":"I\u2019m afraid food drink was overpriced in my view.","3756":"Sandwiches \u00a35Can of drink \u00a32Icecream ( 2 scoops)","3757":"\u00a34","3758":"This is a great zoo.","3759":"Loads to see and all the enclosures looks enriching and the animals seemed very well cared for.","3760":"Would recommend this for a day out for all.","3761":"This was a lovely zoo.","3762":"It was nice to see the pandas, koalas and all of the other animals.","3763":"I would definitely wear some walking boots and prepare for some steep inclines.","3764":"But overall it was a lovely experience.","3765":"Came to the zoo with the kids as they were off school.","3766":"We had a brilliant day out seeing all of the animals.","3767":"A bit disappointed that the pandas were sleeping alongside the tigers.","3768":"But none the less the kids enjoyed themselves, especially running about in the new jurrasic world.","3769":"I did bring a packed lunch however the kids insisted they wanted a kids pizza in the shape of an actual T-Rex!!!","3770":"And I just couldn't resist one too.","3771":"Fantastic and tasty.","3772":"I would 100% recommend.","3773":"As an anniversary treat me and my partner went to Edinburgh zoo as it was our first date.","3774":"It was great walking around seeing all the different animals and would recommend walking straight to the top of the zoo first and working your way down.","3775":"We were pleasantly surprised that at the top of the hill at the new dinosaur part there was an amazing pizza van called Pronto pizza - these neapolitan style pizzas were incredible, completely fresh and cooked to order by some very friendly staff.","3776":"It was amazing seeing the giraffe so up close and the view of Edinburgh is just breathtaking !","3777":"As we wondered back down to the penguins we noticed another food van selling hotdogs called Dognbon - I have never had a hotdog quite like this !","3778":"First of the size - our eyes were definitely bigger than our belly\u2019s and the staff were so helpful and were happy to remove items from the hotdog that I didn\u2019t like.","3779":"We even got some loaded fries to share and were in a nice box which made them easy to carry around with us.","3780":"Over all we had an amazing day and will defo be going back in the summer and really hoping the food trucks are still there.","3781":"We had a lovely family trip to the zoo yesterday helped by the Sunshine.","3782":"Normally avoid the food vans in these kind of places!","3783":"however the smell loured us in.","3784":"The children had from pronto pizza!","3785":"They absolutely loved the dinosaur shaped pizzas.","3786":"A lovely touch!My husband and I had from dog n bone we had the hotdog and loaded fries.","3787":"The prices at first seem a little on the expensive side however what you actually get for your money is fantastic and both vans were delicious!Will definitely return and recommend a visit.","3788":"We absolutely loved this zoo.","3789":"We went on a Thursday at noon.","3790":"There were not a lot of people.","3791":"We enjoyed all the animals.","3792":"My favorite was the koala and the pandas.","3793":"We were lucky to have a beautiful sunny day.","3794":"This was one of the best zoos I have been to and would highly recommend.","3795":"Fantastic day out with the family, the kids absolutely loved it!","3796":"Loved to see local foody businesses set up at the zoo, particularly loved the pizzas!","3797":"Out of all the zoo's I've visited this was my absolute favourite.","3798":"Edinburgh zoo staff were so helpful and lovely.","3799":"To aid entry it's better to pre-book, this was easy online.","3800":"The zoo was exceptionally clean, beautiful trees and flowers everywhere.","3801":"The animals were so well cared for and did us proud by appearing all the way round.","3802":"Our entry was for the afternoon.","3803":"The pandas were a highlight but to be honest all the animals were amazing.","3804":"The views higher up at the zoo, over Edinburgh, were spectacular.","3805":"What a wonderful day we had.","3806":"Easy to get to via bus which stops right outside the zoo.","3807":"Parking is available, but limited, as it is a city zoo.","3808":"I visited with my 9 year old daughter who is obsessed with Panda\u2019s.","3809":"We arrived just before 10am (train from Manchester) and spent a good 6 hours there.","3810":"Firstly, as the zoo is slightly smaller than the local ones to us (Chester and Blackpool) it meant the enclosures were and therefore the animals are closer to you.","3811":"I\u2019d say this is the best zoo we\u2019ve been to for actually getting the best view of the animals.","3812":"We were impressed with the sloths and penguins the most!","3813":"(As well as the Pandas of course!)Take your own food- typical high prices as with other zoos.","3814":"Also, it\u2019s very uphill (we are in Scotland after all!)","3815":"but just a warning for those with any mobility issues.","3816":"It\u2019s a shame this zoo isn\u2019t closer to us as I\u2019d definitely be a member!","3817":"Spent 3 hours visiting this zoo.","3818":"Obviously the star attraction was the Pandas.","3819":"Plenty of other things to see, most of the pens were occupied and animals present.","3820":"Not as good as other zoos such as Artus Zoo in Amsterdam, and think the covid pandemic has taken its toll with respect to income stream and maintenance.","3821":"Still worthy of a visit.","3822":"Combined with trip to local cafe and Scottish museum of modern art","3823":"Had a fab day here with the family.","3824":"Managed to see lots of animals up close, favourites were the penguins, sloths and chimpanzees.","3825":"Also enjoyed a delicious lunch from Rost, my hubby said it was the best chicken burger he\u2019s ever eaten.","3826":"\ud83d\udc4dThe kids loved seeing the dinosaurs too.","3827":"My friend and I revisited the Zoo.","3828":"My friend has a fully qualified assistance dog.","3829":"We were welcomed at the reception desk, our entry tickets and then handled a list of animals and enclosures we were not allowed to see.","3830":"We had expected that we were not going to able go in areas with free moving animals such as the wallaby or Lemar walks","3831":"but however this list stops us seeing any of the big cats, going in any of the animal houses, any of the animals on the ' Afrian plain' and most importantly the Giant Panda.","3832":"We were told the animals might be able to smell the dog or might get scared if the dog barks.","3833":"We looked at the map to try and work out how we could still enjoy our day.","3834":"We were made  aware the keepers will be let know that the dog was in the park therefore we were expected to follow the rules.","3835":"There were a few animals we were allowed to see which we were not allowed to access due to having to walk on pathways past the forbidden animals.","3836":"Having an assistance dog with us massively reduced the amount of animals we were allowed to see.","3837":"To the staff member who drives the 4x4, thank you!","3838":"He took us to see an animal we couldn't access and therefore between my friend and I , we were able to see the panda \ud83d\udc3c we took turns to look after the dog whilst the other quickly looked at the animals.","3839":"This would not have been possible with him so thank you.","3840":"We did not feel welcome and after marking on the map places we couldn't go, we decided to leave.","3841":"We were not able to pass through the Zoo without the help of transportation.","3842":"We were greeted by the manager before leaving to offer a full refund however we had made a special trip up to Edinburgh to spent the day at the zoo so were disappointed by the whole experience.","3843":"Well laid out zoo.","3844":"Really nice to see large enclosures set in amongst the natural landscape of established trees,","3845":"oh and on a big hill!!We saw most the animals including the pandas and koala\u2019s.","3846":"Easy to get to from the city by Lothian bus.","3847":"V busy though and not enough eating establishments without long queues so we gave eating there a miss.","3848":"Fantastic day at the zoo.","3849":"Great value for money and the enclosures are really big.","3850":"This left us feeling smiley inside that the animals had nice homes.","3851":"Need to say some big thank yous.","3852":"One was to the friendly man at the penguins.","3853":"He new all their names and was extremely passionate about his job.","3854":"Thank you for taking thw time to answer all the kids questions (okay they were my questions \ud83d\ude42).We","3855":"had lunch at the picnic area by the dinosaurs.","3856":"Bit windy.","3857":"We ate at the 'Roost' (I think) kiosk.","3858":"Really really really nice guy running it.","3859":"He made us laugh, cooked some great food and made us feel very welcome.","3860":"Massive thankyou to you (sorry, should have got your name).Highly recommend the zoo to anyone visiting from blighty.","3861":"Things to be aware of;It's on a steep hill, but there is always things to distract you from the climb.","3862":"We saw people with buggies but defo looked challenging.","3863":"Toilets are scattered out a bit so get the kids to go when you see one \ud83d\ude42(okay, that's me again).All in all a great zoo, friendly people and the surrounding views are stunning.","3864":"I honestly don't think animals in other zoos have such great views.","3865":"Tiger inclosure is phenomenal !","3866":"We had 4 grown ups, a 4 year old and a 9 year old and a tiny baby in a sling in our party.","3867":"Enjoyable first visit to Edinburgh zoo.","3868":"The enclosures are close together but sometimes separated by hills that we enjoyed climbing up.","3869":"We really enjoyed how close we got to so many animals (squirrel monkeys, baboons, otters, rhinos) as we worked our way systematically past all the enclosures.","3870":"Would recommend to friends and family.","3871":"Came with my girlfriend for the day and we really enjoyed seeing all the animals.","3872":"Plenty of room for the Pandas and Zebras.","3873":"Especially enjoyed the talk about the Giraffe\u2019s from the two girls.","3874":"Extra big shoutout to Rost\u2019s Halloumi fries.","3875":"Might come back for those alone \ud83e\udd24","3876":"Lovely day out with our family.","3877":"We enjoyed the penguins giraffes and play parks.","3878":"The hills were steep but we managed\ud83d\ude33a great way to spend several hours with our family","3879":"Visited Edinbugh Zoo today, first since  covid hit.","3880":"The rain stayed away and it was a really enjoyable experience.","3881":"Not too busy, very small queue to gain entry but it was still lively.","3882":"We loved the play areas and the.while place is well presented.","3883":"The zoo as locals know is situated on a hill and it can be a bit of a hike to the top but its worth it with srar attractions such as the Panda at the summit.","3884":"Everything we wanted to see were out and about so no disappointment today.","3885":"Loved seeing the animals at the zoo today but the highlight was definitely the food from the rost kiosk, unbelievably friendly guy working on the kiosk too!","3886":"Zoo was fantastic, especially the dinosaurs.","3887":"Then to top of with food from R\u00f2st, brisket on fries for the win, fantastic food and friendly staff.","3888":"Would highly recommend to everyone, who passes by.","3889":"Amazing Tour with Rachel from the Education Team for our Scout Troop - honestly can't praise her enough!!","3890":"We all had a fabulous day!","3891":"THankQ","3892":"Spend lovely Saturday in Zoo.","3893":"Amazing zoo, animal are well cared for and their wellbeing is prioritised.","3894":"The Zoo is a lovely environment to walk around, lots of interesting information.","3895":"Great Dino Park at the top of hill - kids love it...","3896":"Good prices for food and drinks.","3897":"Highly recomended Halloumi Fries and Chicken Burger from Rost.","3898":"Kids really enjoyed time there.","3899":"Written January 23, 2022","3900":"The zoo was great!","3901":"Had food at R\u00f3st, chicken burger was delicious!","3902":"And the guy that served us made our day!","3903":"Thank you!!","3904":"The zoo was amazing and we got to see tons of animals, and the food at R\u00f3st was amazing too, would 100% come again.","3905":"I did the half day keeper experience and absolutely loved it!","3906":"Very interesting and personal.","3907":"Liz was very knowledgeable and so friendly.","3908":"One of the animals we looked after were the armadillos.","3909":"I never noticed them when I visited before but they are gorgeous little creatures.","3910":"I can definitely recommend the experience and I will come back for another!The zoo itself is so nice, they try to keep the animals wild and in natural habitat.","3911":"I don\u2018t understand why other people are moaning on here that there isn\u2018t anything to see!I also loved the new dinosaur bit on the top of the hill!","3912":"This is an excellent place to visit.","3913":"We were going to use one of there mobility vehicles because we have trouble walking.","3914":"However we asked about the mobility bus so what they suggested and we agreed was to be taken right to the top and make our way back down.","3915":"We managed to see everything we just took our time and walked down slowly plenty of benches everywhere to have a rest.","3916":"This is an excellent place staff are fantastic as well as all the cared for animals.","3917":"I asked questions and staff were more then happy to answer especially about my favourite penguins.","3918":"Well done all we travelled the day before for 6 hours to see this place and we will be back again.","3919":"Thanks","3920":"We visited at the weekend and had a fantastic family day.","3921":"Our 3 year old loved all the animals, especially the giraffes and the play parks dotted around the zoo were a welcome break from lots of walking!","3922":"The dinosaur exhibition was a brilliant addition.","3923":"Taking a 3 year old and a 6 month old, we were a bit nervous regarding the reviews that stated the zoo is based on a hill.","3924":"It is but all the paths are buggy friendly and I had the baby in a carrier and managed them no problem, my 3 year old walked the majority of the hill and just got in her brothers buggy for a rest close to the top, so please do not let that put you off!","3925":"I think there were also mobility buggy\u2019s available at the entrance for those unable to manage the walking.","3926":"The view of Edinburgh at the top is breathtaking and worth the climb!","3927":"All areas of the park were clean and the animals are clearly well looked after.","3928":"We thought the price tag of just over \u00a350 for the 4 of us (baby free) was very reasonable.","3929":"We\u2019ve visited farms and much smaller zoos closer to home for a very similar price and we few we got much more for our money here!!","3930":"Thank you for a fab day out!","3931":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo for a junior keeper experience for our 9 year old.","3932":"It was a fantastic day!","3933":"The zoo keeper was great with him, answered any questions he had, took time to explain all about the animals.","3934":"He got to feed monkeys, handle\/feed an armadillo, feed\/clean out the red pandas, then feed the meerkats.","3935":"Was a truly memorable experience and would highly recommend to anyone with a love for animals.","3936":"Visited Edinburgh recently and was really excited to go to Edinburgh Zoo.","3937":"Definitely wish I had used my time and money to explore elsewhere.","3938":"Having been to Chester Zoo, this zoo in Edinburgh was just awful and I'm surprised it has so many good reviews.","3939":"There were hardly any animals to see.","3940":"It was more of a strenuous walk than a day at the zoo.","3941":"We had to walk ages just to see a single animal.","3942":"Even when we reached the enclosures, the animals were either not there anymore, hiding, really far away, or the glass was so dirty that you couldn't see a thing (the chimpanzees, for example).The whole point of visiting a zoo is to see the animals.","3943":"We were also unprepared for the amount of steep hills we had to walk up.","3944":"We are young and fit but even we found it quite strenuous and definitely not the relaxing pleasant day out that we were expecting.","3945":"I don't recommend taking elderly relatives here or even young kids or babies in prams.","3946":"The toilets after the entrance at the zoo were also dirty, and there were hardly any cubicles available.","3947":"If you've ever been to a zoo before, you won't like this one as this is far from what a zoo should be.","3948":"Edinburgh zoo is fantastic.","3949":"I have been to many zoos around the world and this one is now in my top few.","3950":"There are plenty of animals, including the pandas, giraffes and sloths, that were just amazing.","3951":"There was also a baby goat born that morning that we arrived, which was pretty cool.","3952":"We had lunch there at the restaurant, which have great baby facilities for my 9month old.","3953":"The zoo is on a hill, but meant we got our exercise in at the same time plus a beautiful view.","3954":"Highly recommend.","3955":"The Edinburgh Zoo is one of our favorite places to visit on our day off!","3956":"Me and my boyfriend are members of the RZSS Society as we have the Annual Passes to the zoo and we plan on continuing our Membership.","3957":"The animals are lovely to watch and we always have a fun day out as we can also get our steps in, while visiting!","3958":"It's beautifully placed on a hill so the walk can get tricky in places but has loads of resting spots and places to eat and relax!","3959":"Ofcourse food is slightly pricey but it's all going towards an amazing cause!","3960":"We sometimes bring out picnic to have on top of the hill and at times also eat at the restaurant.","3961":"Last time I was there I had these great halloumi fries !!","3962":"I hope the staff knows how much we appreciate their hard work and efforts towards all these amazing and beautiful animals we get to encounter and experience!!","3963":"Both of us will continue to support the society as it's our happy place!","3964":"\ud83d\udc95","3965":"Disappointed with this zoo used to be good years ago with lots of bird aviaries sadly no longer there .","3966":"Too many empty enclosures like the old panda one.","3967":"Won\u2019t be back here in a hurry will stick going to Chester","3968":"Not been to the Edinburgh Zoo in years.","3969":"It is still a good day out.","3970":"Our kids are the young and they had been wanting to go for ages.","3971":"The zoo also have a new dinosaur exhibit for 2022 right at the top of the Zoo.","3972":"The zoo is located on a hill so be prepared to walk.","3973":"We didn't eat at the Zoo  but it is pricey but its what you also expect.","3974":"The Bodongo trail is great.","3975":"The penguins are always a top attraction but unfortunately the parade is still unavailable.","3976":"The pandas have also moved since my last visit.","3977":"I was knackered after my visit but will be back.","3978":"Kids loved it.","3979":"The main reason I am giving the Zoo such a low rating is because:I simply cannot understand why the sandwiches being sold a cafe there  (the Penguin Cafe) have Palm Oil in.","3980":"This is unbelievably crap to be honest, given the destruction harvesting palm oil wreaks on the habitits of many of the animals in the zoo.","3981":"There was even a sign by the Sun Bear enclosure all about this, and then around the corner you're selling products with palm oil.","3982":"Please, please, please do better Edinburgh Zoo.","3983":"Because if you can't even set a good example as an organisation that supposed to support conservation, then there is no hope.","3984":"Really bad was there on 30\/4\/22 and found it to be not great.","3985":"Some areas could have been cleaner.","3986":"We made the mistake of assuming we could eat there so expensive and not very clean.","3987":"We left early and had food elsewhere.","3988":"We found it uncomfortable when a worker was wandering around with dark glasses on and you could not see what he was watching we have young kids.","3989":"Not a great deal to see and being on a hill a very hard walk for children.","3990":"We thought the penguins would be off limits due to bird flu but little care on that side.","3991":"Tolets were small and dirty with no cleaners.","3992":"Food wrapping on ground we found 3 dirty face masks and they are not even in force now.","3993":"Very dirty place.","3994":"When I was a child I went there and it was very different it has I proved since then.","3995":"We never took photos as when we saw pens Animals were either hiding all the pens were empty I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll be back again this year we\u2019ll see if it\u2019s a bit cleaner and a bit more open next year it\u2019s not a bad Zoo it\u2019s just not good for us.","3996":"Visited the zoo last week with the family.","3997":"The zoo is on the side of a hill so be prepared for aching legs.","3998":"Quite disappointed with many parts of the zoo.","3999":"The chimpanzee house seemed dark and dirty within the areasQuite a lot of the animals could not be seen or were hiding.","4000":"Take a picnic or packed lunch as the Penguin restaurant looked as if the monkeys had their dinner in there.","4001":"It was dirty and a rip off for food and drinks.","4002":"The best part was the Chinese pandas, you can see that there has been money spent in this area.","4003":"We visited Edinburgh zoo recently and was not disappointed.","4004":"The highlights for us were the pandas and koalas but there was so much to see.","4005":"There are a lot of hills but found them fine to manage over the day.","4006":"We took our own food but saw a few options for a places to eat.","4007":"We were also impressed by the dinosaur area, there was more to see than expected.","4008":"Definitely recommended for a day out if in the area.","4009":"Fantastic day out and well worth the walk, wouldn't be buying food or beverages though as its an absolute rip off,  Take a picnic with you.","4010":"Visited on 13 April with my daughter.","4011":"Had a nice leisurely stroll around.","4012":"The zoo is found on a hill so it could be a little difficult if not fully able.","4013":"Toilet facilities are ok.","4014":"The conveniences next to the penguin cafe have tiny cubicles and I am not a big person!","4015":"The cafe itself was Stacked out.","4016":"The girl making the drinks deserves a big pay rise.","4017":"The queue was relentless and she coped brilliantly.","4018":"More people should be employed in there though.","4019":"As only two staff taking money and making drinks, the sit down area was a complete mess with bins overflowing.","4020":"They didn\u2019t have 5 minutes to leave their station to clean up, the zoo needs to address this.","4021":"All in all it was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon, probably about 4 hours is all that\u2019s needed here.","4022":"We (2 adults & 8yr old) visited during the summer holidays so as expected there was a queue to get in but it did seem to move relatively quickly.","4023":"Firstly there was torrential rain for several hours when we visited so make sure you wear waterproof shoes.","4024":"Given the rain we were pleasantly surprised to see the majority of the animals but we did have to look carefully for them.","4025":"We did have to visit the rhinos & the sun bear twice to see them but was worth it.","4026":"A lot of other visitors took one glance & moved on so didn't see half of what we saw so take your time looking.","4027":"If you take the straight route to the top of the zoo it is extremely steep, we went in a zig zag to see other animals & this was much more manageable.","4028":"The view from the top was fantastic especially as it stopped raining whilst we were up there.","4029":"My only issue was the rain made a few areas like the steps near one of the cafes feel a bit unsafe as they practically turned into a waterfall!","4030":"As mentioned it was torrential rain for most of the day","4031":"so I don't think the keepers could have done anything except maybe close those steps.","4032":"Overall a great zoo with a huge variety of animals with interesting facts but definitely take your waterproofs!","4033":"The Zoo is a fantastic day out, and to see the panda\u2019s was amazing, it\u2019s a great day out for all ages.","4034":"It\u2019s very hilly with some steep hills but you can call for transport included in the ticket price, and it would be worth using is you have mobility problems.","4035":"Loved our day there.","4036":"Had a great day!","4037":"It's our third visit and we always enjoy it.","4038":"Went earlier this month and we pre-booked tickets online, which was easy to do.","4039":"The queue was not very long and they had three manned desks processing tickets through so we were soon in the Zoo.","4040":"I admit I moaned about there being no separate fast track entry provided for people who pre book","4041":"but we still got through quickly.","4042":"It's built on a hill but by choosing a zigzag approach which matches the layout out of the exhibits you can make the walking about relatively undemanding.","4043":"For those that need it there's a mobility vehicle service available which you can ask staff about on arrival or you can look up details on their website.","4044":"Eateries include hotdog stand type eateries in about 5 locations, a cafe and restaurant.","4045":"Foods a bit pricey for all options but the portions were generous.","4046":"Plenty of toilets and the gift shop has many quite reasonably priced items.","4047":"Unfortunately the rhino (a favourite of mine from past visits) was no where to be seen and in fact so were a few of the other larger exhibits, e.g. the female panda and the ant eater but that is understandable.","4048":"Sometimes the animals need their rest time or need treatment.","4049":"The pygmy hippos were cute, one daring meerkat approached my daughter and sat next to her on the other side of its enclosure and appeared to take a liking to her.","4050":"The flamingoes are gorgeous.","4051":"The goats were playful and one in particular seemed to realise it was being admired and I swear it was showing off.","4052":"We saw the gorgeous giraffes apparently happy to be admired, curious snakes popping out of hideaways to look at us,  magnificent tigers, sleepy male panda and many other larger mammals and reptiles; including the barking male lion who sounds very dog like when he follows up his roars with bark like sounds.","4053":"The other lions looked unfazed by his posturing but we were all impressed.","4054":"I'm from the West Riding, hilly country is part of my regular life experience.","4055":"I found reaching the top of the hill upon which the Zoo nestles no particular challenge, especially since you're not actually supposed to mount the hill like your storming a castle and meant to take your time.","4056":"I think some people rush zoo visits thinking that they can cover a lot of ground in an hour.","4057":"The view at the top is magnificent and you really need to allocate at least the entire afternoon to have a satisfying visit.","4058":"Also, we found if we didn't spot some of the animals on the way up we could give them a quick visit on the way down and we were actually rewarded by doing so.","4059":"Fantastic couple of hours at the Dino Bites experience.","4060":"Friendly and informative Rangers led us up to the new Dino exhibit, which is excellent.","4061":"Nice to see some updated features (e.g. feathers on the raptors) on the models.","4062":"After finishing up at the exhibit we headed indoors for some breakfast, a little activity for the wee ones and a cuddly toy as well.","4063":"All in all, well worth the money.","4064":"Recommended for all the family.","4065":"Lovely Zoo, easily spend hours here.","4066":"Large size, good to walk around, easily wheelchair accessible.","4067":"Lots of areas for refreshments\/ lots of toiles facilities at regular spots on the route.","4068":"One of the best zoo's in the UK.","4069":"So many animals and interesting to learn about the research taking place there.","4070":"We had prebooked tickets but there was still a huge queue to enter the zoo, even with an alloted time.","4071":"Once inside it was ok as people spread out.","4072":"We used the kids for a quid rail ticket to get free entry for the kids - see Scotrail for details.","4073":"We hadn't realised how steep the zoo is, so if you have mobility problems or young children be prepared!","4074":"Great views from the top though.","4075":"Our main reason for visiting was to see the giant pandas, both of which were of course asleep!Overall I have to say this isn't the best zoo I have been to.","4076":"The chimpanzees looked bored and one looked distressed especially with people banging on the glass at them.","4077":"I had to leave the area as I felt so sorry for them, I really don't think they should be in a zoo.","4078":"There were a lot of penguins and it was interesting to see them making their nests but again people were shouting at them and banging on the glass and it was right next to a kids play area, hardly a calm environment for them.","4079":"I wouldn't return, mainly because the animals didn't look happy at all but also because it was so steep and hard to walk around and there were not many places to sit for a picnic.","4080":"There are much nicer wildlife parks in the UK, I wouldn't return.","4081":"Excellent day out.","4082":"Prebooked, although the queue was long to get it in went down quick.","4083":"Lovely views at the top as zoo is on a hill","4084":"Haven't been to Edinburgh zoo for 42 years, last time was our honeymoon.","4085":"The weather was good so that helped and really enjoyed our day here.","4086":"Easy to get a bus from the town centre on number 12,  26 or 31 bus that drops you off directly opposite the front doors.","4087":"Never really liked zoos as the animals are in captivity,  but if the world is going so badly because of us humans and habitats are being destroyed by people then at least animals here have a chance to live a long life here in safety.","4088":"The Zoo has a new exhibit at the very top of the hill it's built on.","4089":"Dinosaurs!!","4090":"No not live ones, like Jurassic Park!","4091":"Large models that move.","4092":"Loved our day here.","4093":"Omg if you ain't visited here you need to.","4094":"Amazing zoo","4095":"and they have loads of animals that you do not see in many zoos.","4096":"Animals are close to you aswell when you go and see them.","4097":"Cafe was ok but didn't have much food choices so I would say to take.food like we did.","4098":"Buses from the city centre go all the time and is not far to the zoo.","4099":"The shop that does the gifts EST is really good and not badly priced either.","4100":"Pandas are the best bit of the zoo though.","4101":"Lots of animals to see, and all the animals looked happy which was fantastic!Only point which was negative, was that it was really busy and found it hard to view some of the animals such as the chimpanzees or the pandas.","4102":"So keep that in mind when visiting!Spent hours viewing all the animals.","4103":"A personal favourite were the sloths, and Koalas.","4104":"It was feeding time for the sloths and got to see one up close!Highly recommend.","4105":"I did a junior zookeeper experience on Wednesday the 13th of April with my brother it was amazing the keeper took us around and explained everything very clearly.","4106":"I had a great time and I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to do it.","4107":"Today I visited the zoo with my sister who requires assistance when getting about, we had alot of support from all members of staff as we moved around the zoo, all very cheerful and generally happy to assist us, one women in particular called nikki bayliss helped my sister from a very long que to get in and escorted her into the zoo entrance where she provided her with a seat and a good chat until I reached the tills to enter, nikki also arranged a scooter for my sister to get around the zoo.","4108":"These scooters where a life saver for my sister and the zoo definitely should purchase more to help those less able to manoeuvre around.","4109":"Loved the zoo today!","4110":"It was our first time here and i couldn\u2019t have had a better day.","4111":"Loved seeing the giant pandas, koala bears and many more animals which we had never seen before.","4112":"Whilst there was quite a queue when we first arrived, it went down very quickly and we were in within 10 minutes.","4113":"The zoo is spread out and a great day out with lovely scenery.","4114":"There are many kiosks and cafes open to get drinks and snack to fuel you for a day of walking around the hilly (but enjoyable) park.","4115":"The enclosures are well kept and spacious so the animals can roam where they want.","4116":"Overall, a lovely day out for all and a must when visiting Edinburgh!","4117":"We had a really nice day.","4118":"Went 10-3 and saw lots of wonderful animals.","4119":"The best being the lion, giraffes, pandas and the dinosaur experience too.","4120":"We are at the grasslands restaurant which was ok.","4121":"\u00a34 for chips which isn\u2019t too bad, especially as it started to rain","4122":"and we were indoors.","4123":"A few play parks where dotted around which broke things up for our youngest aged 3.An enjoyable day out.","4124":"Really loved the Zoo.","4125":"The staff are really friendly and knowledgeable.","4126":"I loved seeing all the animals especially the Penguins and Giraffes.","4127":"I really enjoyed seeing the Sloth as I\u2019ve never seen one before.","4128":"The Zoo was really peaceful, well planned out and tidy.","4129":"Would definitely recommend a visit.","4130":"We loved our trip to the zoo!","4131":"The best animal experiences were the tigers, giraffes, penguins and the monkeys.","4132":"They all looked happy and the enclosures were big.","4133":"We ate food at the top - the pizza\u2019s were lovely and two were enough for the four of us!","4134":"The only issue was the queue and staff in the penguin cafe - a smile goes a long way \ud83d\ude00 A great day out and a highlight of our trip!","4135":"This is probably the best zoo that I have ever visited!","4136":"I spent a good 5 hours walking around it and it had so many animals to view and they all lived in really nice","4137":"and well kept closures.","4138":"The zoo had stunning views from the top of the hill and great value for money considering they have the only koala and panda bears in the UK.","4139":"Edinburgh Zoo is an interesting visit but tough if  you have mobility issues.","4140":"Some of the paths are very steep.","4141":"However the staff were all very friendly and helpful and there is transport up and down if you need help.","4142":"Very easy to get too by public transport, a bus stops right outside.","4143":"I booked my partner the half day zookeeper experience for a special birthday.","4144":"I was a bit unsure how it would work following him round as a normal zoo visitor but Kirsty made sure the non-keepers on the experience were also included as much as possible which was great!","4145":"I had a brilliant time snapping photos of the day!My partner got to feed: chimps, red pandas, meerkats, armadillos and sloths.","4146":"He really enjoyed the experience and its something he will remember for his big birthday!","4147":"You can see how close he got to the red pandas from the photo with this review!Kirsty was so knowledgeable and friendly.","4148":"She was a brilliant host!Cannot recommend the zookeeper experience highly enough!!","4149":"Myself and my adult daughter really enjoyed our visit, though I am not going to lie, as others have said the hills are a struggle (I have arthritis).","4150":"My highlight was having a sheet of glass between myself and a giant panda.","4151":"My daughter adored seeing the koalas and the very curious penguins swimming up to you to look at you through the glass.","4152":"A lot of the animals were cosied up inside and not moving, so we missed out on seeing a few animals properly.","4153":"We were there over 4 hours and still didn't see all the enclosures.","4154":"It was easy and cheap to get to on the bus.","4155":"The staff were very welcoming and very approachable.","4156":"Very very hilly.","4157":"Don't take your granny lol.","4158":"Lovely zoo, some of the walk throughs weren't open on this visit.","4159":"We missed a few animals due to all the climbing, we're not used to it, we come from a flat town haha.","4160":"Lots of toilet stops which is good.","4161":"Hot chocolate was spot on.","4162":"I think the sloths were my favourite!","4163":"Wow double wow, this place is amazing, if a tad on the hilly side.","4164":"The staff are amazing especially the lady giving the sun bear talk.","4165":"All the animals look happy and have large enclosures we especially loved seeing the koalas (nearly brought me to tears, because I\u2019d finally seen my spirit animal) and the pandas and the tigers and gibbons and penguins.","4166":"It\u2019s incredibly clean and generally very welcoming.","4167":"You\u2019ve got to go round this place, but it is a whole day thing, we spent 5 hours there.","4168":"was absolutely brilliant as since i last visited the wallaby walkthrough area has opened aling with the new panda enclosures and giraffe enclosures  as well as the dinosaur area.","4169":"Kids were blown away totally recommend a visit.","4170":"To be honest one cant visit Edinburgh and not visit the zoo.","4171":"We went to Edinburgh zoo.","4172":"The zoo was good we went to penguin cafe and the prices were very high for soup a Luke warm cheese and onion pastie and a ham and cheese roll and can of iron bru it cost \u00a318 .","4173":"Staff were not helpful or friendly wish we never went in","4174":"We were absolutely blown away by our experience at this Zoo.","4175":"Having gone to Chester soo many times over the years this gave us an expectation of what a zoo would be like, however Edinburgh Zoo surpassed our expectations of what a zoo trip could be like.","4176":"We came up close to animals that we were only able to gaze at from a far at other zoos and this is what left us with that wow feeling at the end of the trip, in particular the giraffes which we came up close too on the balcony viewing area.","4177":"We were also able to get close to the sloths, honey bears and best of all the panda which was just amazing!The value for money for our experience of the day was great and we would certainly return to the zoo again.","4178":"A must see when in Edinburgh!","4179":"Huge variation of animals to see and they're all in nice spacious habitats which is lovely to see.","4180":"Plenty of clean toilets dotted around so you're never caught short.","4181":"Would be quite the workout if you've got a little one in a pram or somebody in a wheelchair so do be wary of that.","4182":"However most of Edinburgh is hills","4183":"anyway","4184":"so it's not far from the norm.","4185":"The view of the giraffes is particularly impressive and penguin rock is really cool.","4186":"We came to Edinburgh soley for the zoo, to see the pandas and I was not disappointed.","4187":"Upon arrival the car park was free, we then queued for 50 minutes to enter the zoo.","4188":"Once in the zoo, its on hills, so be cautious of this.","4189":"When we got to the pandas, they were sleeping however luckily for us it was about to be feeding time, where the pandas are encouraged out of there sleep, and outside to snack on some bamboo, it was a wholesome experience and glad we got to see this before they go back to China.","4190":"We must have stayed at the panda enclosure for a good hour.","4191":"Food and drink prices were expensive and so was the gift shop.","4192":"the worst zoo i have ever been to.1. 2-3 mile long que to get it.2.","4193":"lack of food , one cafe was shut other 2 options were overpriced chuck wagons and  a sandwich cafe.3. animals not in cages nothing to see .4.","4194":"THE HILL, i had heard that the zoo was build on a hill but i never thought much of it as i am a healthy guy BUT OMG you are constantly walking up a steep hill to see aminals that only once you get there are all sleeping well no wonder walking up and down a hill all day has to be the most terrible place you can build a zoo on the planet i will never be back ever again.","4195":"THE best zoo i have been to in the UK is Blackpool zoo , Edinburgh zoo does not even come close .","4196":"avoid","4197":"Pre booked a time slot of 11am and had to queue until 12:15 before getting into the zoo.","4198":"With young children one of which has disabilities this was not good.","4199":"It was an extremely hot day and there was no signs or staff telling you what was happening or if we were even in the correct queue.","4200":"Once we got into the zoo the amount of no show animals and empty exhibits was poor.","4201":"Especially after having paid nearly 70 pound to get in.","4202":"It\u2019s a very expensive day for a very poor visitor experience.","4203":"Total waste of time.","4204":"Pre-booked an entry time slot as required and then arrive to find a queue stretching back to the far end of the car park.","4205":"Clearly not enough staff to handle the number of visitors.","4206":"Lovely zoo to visit, free parking, animals look v peaceful in their environment, great to see the pandas who were both quite active and walked about their enclosures, an excellent penguin area, lots of picnic spots and excellent tea and coffee in the cafe.","4207":"But 2 problems1.","4208":"Lots of road works in the area so getting there is not easy.2.","4209":"The zoo is described as being on a slope, this is an understatement.","4210":"My wife at present is having hip and back problems and had great difficulty getting up some of the steep inclines, especially to the pandas.","4211":"I think that should be more obvious in the description of the zoo.","4212":"Overall v good","4213":"and we will revisit when her mobility issues have settled.","4214":"Absolutely amazing!","4215":"Totally worth the visit \u2014 was a super sunny day too!","4216":"Just a heads up - it is hilly in some areas and the food is a tad expensive especially if visiting with a big family.","4217":"Loved penguin food watching and the pandas were amazing.","4218":"A special thanks to Rebecca who was super helpful and showed us the wallabies and kangaroos and had a smiley face all the time :)","4219":"Brilliant zoo experience, arguably the best we've had.","4220":"Very fortunate that it was a clear, sunny day and being a weekday it was quiet.","4221":"Saw all the animals up close, particularly our son's favourites - pandas, tigers, lions, penguins, monkeys and more.","4222":"Easily accessble from the city centre on any number of buses.","4223":"As per other reviews, just keep in mind the zoo is on a very steep hill, lots of walking and with a buggy, hard work at times!","4224":"Such a great experience.","4225":"As a disabled person I was worried about being able to cope with the steep terrain.","4226":"I took a mobility scooter with me and on arrival we were given a map showing which paths had steps and steep gradients which aren\u2019t suitable for wheelchairs and the alternative routes around the park.","4227":"The young lady on the ticket desk then told us that they have a electric mobility van which could take us to the top of the park and we could then make our way down past all the animals.","4228":"If you want to start off walking but it gets too much you can call the number at any time and it will pick you up.","4229":"We met the van just outside the ticket area and he loaded me, my scooter and my companion into the vehicle and off we wentCharles our driver was so lovely and knowledgable telling us where all the animals were, and lots of facts about them.","4230":"He is a credit to the zoo as he made the trip interesting.","4231":"We then offloaded outside the giraffe house and made our way back down from there.","4232":"All the animal areas were accessible and the less steep paths clearly marked on our accessible map.","4233":"The cafes and restaurant areas were accessible too.","4234":"There are also lots of accessible toilet facilities dotted all around the park if you need them.","4235":"You will probably need the help of a companion to get through some of the animal viewing area doors as they aren\u2019t automatic opening but that is the only area that they could possibly improve on - installing disabled access buttons on the animal viewing areas and restaurants to assist those not accompanied.3 hours later we arrived back at the shop which has good variety of budget, mid range and high quality souvenirs for you to browse with plenty of space to get round.","4236":"Every member of staff we encountered were very friendly and knowledgeable about the animals they care for.","4237":"Definitely worth a visit even if you are less able.","4238":"This is a fantastic zoo which we really enjoyed visiting.","4239":"It has lots of different animals and we liked seeing the panda - we haven\u2019t seen one in any other UK zoo","4240":"before!The food stalls were easy to find and reasonably priced.","4241":"I also enjoyed the penguin feeding experience where the keeper was knowledgable and gave us a good amount of time with the penguins.","4242":"The only thing that put a slight dampener on it was how hilly the zoo is.","4243":"Normally this wouldn\u2019t be a problem, but pushing a fully loaded pram around the zoo in hot weather was very hard work!","4244":"I would recommend an infant carrier here if you have one!","4245":"This was a great day out, especially for our additional needs family.","4246":"They have worked so hard to make themselves accessible taking autism into account significantly, not just giving a discount\/free carer spot then waving you in.","4247":"We were offered sensory bags for the children which were wonderful, we didn\u2019t begrudge the refundable deposit at all.","4248":"These had been so carefully thought through containing ear defenders, sunglasses, fidget toys and the most wonderful sensory map of the zoo.","4249":"Just to be asked on our way in \u201cis there anything we can do to make your visit easier?\u201d","4250":"Was such a unique experience.","4251":"We didn\u2019t feel like a burden or judged, just accommodated.","4252":"When there was a queue for the restaurant, we were brought to the front of the queue without question which meant we didn\u2019t have to fear a queuing meltdown.","4253":"When one of our children staged a sit down protest, the mobility vehicle plugged the gap to give us a short ride up the hill and give her a reset to enjoy the rest of the day.","4254":"It was great to see the animals, especially the squirrel monkeys who came up to the viewing window and enjoyed interacting with the children.","4255":"All in all a great day out with all the accommodations we needed to just be able to enjoy our day out.","4256":"Thank you Edinburgh Zoo!","4257":"You need to teach other large attractions how to do this right!","4258":"I took my mum here for a day out and there was a very good variety of animals.","4259":"I was however a bit upset at some of the enclosures.","4260":"I appreciate the conservation work being done here but some of the larger animals would maybe look more comfortable in a safari park with room to run around.","4261":"The tigers and the giraffes in particular looked extremely agitated.","4262":"I think we both left a bit upset by this.","4263":"I found the staff incredibly helpful, the restuarant menu was limited but a generous portion of chicken salad.","4264":"Can't complain about the price, it must cost a fortune to care for these beautiful creatures.","4265":"Whilst there are a lot of different animals, some of the larger animals such as Rhinos and Lions don\u2019t have enough room in their enclosures.","4266":"It seems a lot of work (to much)  has gone into giving the pandas a large enclosure but the Big cats have barely any room at all compared to their normal habitat.","4267":"I actually found that the Capuchin Monkeys had a larger enclosure that 2 rhinos.","4268":"Read what I could about the zoo before I went as I wanted to see the Pandas.","4269":"Read it was a sloping area, but nothing prepared me for the 1in 7 and 1in 5 hills throughout the zoo.","4270":"With the Pandas being at the top it was nearly 20 mins of hard work to even get to their enclosure.","4271":"I was exhausted when I got to the enclosure and had to sit down for 10 mins to get my breath back.","4272":"I am a fairly fit 80 year old but the zoo did for me as you seemed to be constantly going up or downhill.","4273":"I had minimum chance to look at the animals as I spent most of my time trying not to fall over.","4274":"No alternative means of transportation was available, so you climbed or you stayed put.","4275":"The zoo itself is ok","4276":"but there's nothing in this zoo that you can't find in any other zoo","4277":"so I was quite bored because of that and the ques are also big.","4278":"Had a lovely time even despite the rain.","4279":"I was so excited to see all of the animals, especially the sloths.","4280":"We walked into the Sloth and Armadillo enclosure, and spotted Moana straight away which was amazing.","4281":"We then met Emily, who happily answered my questions about the pair of sloths.","4282":"She was so lovely, and was very easy to chat to.","4283":"Even recommending who we should visit next.","4284":"I definitely want to go back and get a zoo keeper experience next.","4285":"Arrived at the zoo to be greeted by a lovely gentleman on the ticket desk who after realising that my husband has slight issues with walking advised us of the mobility vehicle that was available and immediately called to find out when it would be available, 10 mins later we were greeted by another amazing gentleman who whilst driving us up to the top of the zoo talked about the animals we saw and a bit about the zoo.","4286":"All the animals were amazing and I took lots of amazing photos.","4287":"Unfortunately the only thing that ruined the day for us was the food!","4288":"We ate at the penguin cafe and not only was there not a great deal of choice - not everyone wants mustard or mayonnaise on all tje sandwiches but the staff were rude and pretty much threw my husband's scone at him!!","4289":"They were also unable to wear their masks correctly not even covering their noses!","4290":"It was such a shame and left us dissapointed.","4291":"We would not stop this visiting again but we would have to consider bringing our own food!","4292":"This was an amazing day out!!!","4293":"We decided to visit this Zoo as we were in Edinburgh for our 10 year anniversary.","4294":"We didn\u2019t know much about it or what it had in store for us!We were taken back by the quality of the animal enclosures, the selection of animals and the general atmosphere of the place!","4295":"Felt very clean and well looked after!We were especially blown away by the Tiger feed and talk time, where Maurice (Zoo Employee, modern day David Attenborough) answered all our questions with passion!","4296":"What a guy!","4297":"We were then greeted by Lucu (I believe his name is) the male Tiger who fully demonstrated his power by standing right over us!Amazing place!","4298":"Get yourself there!","4299":"We all really enjoyed our day at the zoo.","4300":"Highlight was watching the sloths being fed whilst the zoo keeper gave us very interesting facts.","4301":"The children\u2019s favourites were the chimpanzees, Koalas and Pandas.","4302":"Many magnificent animals to see, the zoo is laid in a maze of paths but we found our way around with the help of the map.","4303":"The only tricky bit was trying to find the giraffes with the path closures, a temporary sign would be a good idea  with directions to go through the tigers.","4304":"It was worth the perseverance though as the giraffe enclosure was very impressive.","4305":"Overall a fantastic day out","4306":"and we thought very reasonably priced entrance fee and gift shop.","4307":"Also we took our own picnic and used the covered seating areas to sit under.","4308":"Highly recommend, just wished we lived nearby!","4309":"Great guest experience from check in to leave.","4310":"(I think the colleague's name was Rachel, apologies if wrong.","4311":"She was so thorough and friendly at the same time and had a smile the whole time).It was a little awkward the way the paths were set out, but nae bother if used to climbing a wee hill :)","4312":"Wonderful day trip to the zoo, so many amazing animals to see!","4313":"Saw a panda for the first time and it was incredible!","4314":"The staff were all super helpful and friendly, and mask wearing indoors was enforced which was a relief.","4315":"The cafe had great food options too.","4316":"After a protracted journey to Edinburgh thanks to Storm Eunice, we joined the zoo bright and early for a Junior Keeper experience led by the lovely, knowledgeable keeper, Liz.","4317":"After a short introduction to cover all the health and safety, aspects, we headed to the Red Panda enclosure where the Junior Keepers joined Liz to clean out and feed the pandas who came down to enjoy the bamboo straight from their hands.","4318":"Next came feeding meerkats and Gibbons, before rounding off the experience with sloths and armadillo.","4319":"This was a \"once in a lifetime \" treat for our 8yr old and it certainly will be remembered for a lifetime, both for the interaction with the animals and the care and knowledge shared by Liz.","4320":"This left us the afternoon to wander round the zoo","4321":"and it was as if the animals were deliberately out to show us a good time, with close views and displays from penguin, rhino, tigers, giraffe, panda and sun bears, not to mention the wee beasties.","4322":"What a wonderful way to spend a day, highly recommended.","4323":"An excellent zoo with a wide variety of animals including pandas.","4324":"We booked an animal experience which sadly had to change as penguins were in danger of flu at time.","4325":"Sloths were a great substitute.","4326":"Keeper was informative and friendly and we had the best time.","4327":"Highly recommend!","4328":"We visited whilst on a short break to Edinburgh as our young son is obsessed with pandas and wow they didn\u2019t dissapoint!","4329":"We have visited many zoos but loved seeing animals that we hadn\u2019t seen before especially the koalas.","4330":"It was great to see so many animals so close up.","4331":"The animals all looked well cared for and there were lots of good information points.","4332":"We found the facilities excellent and had food outside from one of the vans which was really nice.","4333":"We were lucky to have a dry day with lots of sunshine but there looked to be several indoor areas to get food or covered outdoor areas for your own picnic.","4334":"Kids loved the play area.","4335":"I would highly recommend a visit and would definitely return.","4336":"We visited the zoo at the beginning of a school holiday week, so we did expect it to be busy, however it was crammed.","4337":"The exhibits were good, we saw plenty of animals and there was good information about the animals on display.","4338":"It was great being able to get up really close and personal with quite a few creatures and this was a highlight of the trip.","4339":"The zoo is really hilly and anyone with poor mobility would struggle.","4340":"There is a need for more staff - any places where there were signs for people to be quiet, no tap or bang glass, no loud or sudden movements had all of the above!","4341":"Some people were screaming, banging and shouting.","4342":"Obviously not the zoo\u2019s fault, but something they unfortunately may need to monitor on busy days.","4343":"Avoid holiday periods, take your time and it\u2019ll be a great day for all ages!","4344":"This is a really good zoo and the only place in the Uk to visit the giant panda.","4345":"Their is a good selection of animalsonly criticism  it is on a hill so if you are elderly or need to push anyone around it will be difficult.","4346":"Lovely to see the pandas and the tigers and the penguins having a bit of a play despite the hideous weather.","4347":"Beautiful animals and park, awful weather\u2026But it didn\u2019t matter we had a great time!","4348":"Visited Fruday with granddaughter and her friend.","4349":"Supposed to close at 4.00 p.m.","4350":"Penguins closed at 3.15; thrown out of cafe at 3.30 and out by 4.50.","4351":"What time does the Zoo close.","4352":"I'm a member, but is it worth it.","4353":"Nearly \u00a320 for two kids and \u00a316 for tea and a small cake.","4354":"I know Zoo is strapped for cash, but is it helping itself?","4355":"Great few hours spent at the zoo today.","4356":"I think we chose the wrong time of year to visit as we rushed our visit because we were cold and wet!I have been to many zoos but have never seen a koala so that was pretty special, and we really enjoyed the sloth and armadillo area- thanks to Elise for the fun facts.","4357":"Pygmy hippos were so sweet as well.","4358":"Only improvements I would make would be the signage, it wasn't too clear what animals were where and could have done with a few more fun facts about them.","4359":"Overall great day, would recommend :-)","4360":"Great place to see animals, great staff, great food, the light shows r great and the shops there r very good.","4361":"Zoo was so quiet and the emptiness added to the amazing experience.","4362":"Saw nearly every animal that was able to see.","4363":"One of the best parts of the day was the staff members.","4364":"Don't recall his name unfortunately but one of the staff was so lovely and informative.","4365":"Showed us around the sloth and armadillo enclosure and we even caught up to him in the lion viewing platform and the banteng enclosure.","4366":"Was very good at telling about every animal and guiding people on where to go.","4367":"We were there Tuesday 25th from half 10 to half 3..","4368":"Hope this may reach him so he knows what a great job he's doing.","4369":"Can tell he loves his job.","4370":"Great customer service.","4371":"Over the moon with this visit","4372":"Fantastic family day out, we had an great time here with friends and family recently seeing all the amazing animals.","4373":"On arrival we were greeted with a large free car park, which was a bonus.","4374":"Easy booking system online and very friendly reception staff on arrivalThe zoo is quite hilly, but it was nice to be able to walk around at your own pace, taking in all the amazing animals, in their enclosures with all the viewing areas\/windows so you get a better view.","4375":"So many highlights, from Giraffes, to the Zebras, Penguins to the meerkat,  too many to mention.","4376":"A few cafes dotted around, but quite expensive, \u00a35 for a basic sandwich,  I noticed a few people brought their own a picnic,  which would be my preferred option on next visit as plenty of outdoor seating options.","4377":"Overall though a very enjoyable day out.","4378":"Amazing visit.","4379":"Can\u2019t wait to visit in summer when more attractions are open.","4380":"There was only 1 attraction closed and some cafes but still amenities.","4381":"Very clean around the zoo and great viewing points to watch the animals.","4382":"Love seeing the penguins!","4383":"I\u2019ve chosen to go in the middle as there is good and bad.","4384":"I will get the bad out the way first.","4385":"I booked tickets after thinking they had electric wheelchair hire.","4386":"When arrive I was told they didn\u2019t have any so I suggested they made this clearer on the site.","4387":"I was offered the electric vehicle which dropped u off at the top and you walk down or a manual wheelchair, but after seeing just how steep it was from the car park, it will of not been possible to have a manual one.","4388":"Secondly I felt that some of the enclosures were way to small in comparison to other zoo\u2019s.","4389":"One of the routes up at the top of the zoo had a road closure - this was not mentioned on arrival and considering my disability would of helped to know about it to avoid unnecessary walking.","4390":"Lastly I didn\u2019t see one enclosure advertise feeding times which would have been good to see, especially as some animals were not visible in their enclosure.","4391":"On they good side the animals were amazing to see.","4392":"We watched some staff working with the chimps to use a computer screen.","4393":"The information in this area was also very interesting.","4394":"The panda were fantastic, never seen them anywhere before.","4395":"Got to see baby monkey, but can\u2019t remember the exact kind.","4396":"I don\u2019t come from this area","4397":"so I would not be visiting again.","4398":"It is worth going though, but please be very aware of the zoo being on a up hill climb.","4399":"It is mentioned on the site but we didn\u2019t really think it would be a bad as it was.","4400":"This is a great zoo with so much to see.","4401":"The zoo is on a hill so it is a hard walk but can do it at your own pace.","4402":"There are so many animals here and great enclosures.","4403":"The keeper and friendly and helpful and full of information.","4404":"The staff were friendly.","4405":"We visited Jan 22 and paid full price for the tickets.","4406":"Lovely zoo with some nice animals though we were a bit annoyed some of the areas were closed under the guise of \u2018covid\u2019 though they seem to pick and choose as the tiny cafes are all open.","4407":"The giraffe viewing platform was closed for absolutely no reason which meant having to watch from a fence quite a way away.","4408":"We completely understand that the zoo has an upkeep though a ticket reduction like other venues should be considered when the quality of the attractions is reduced.","4409":"Still a enjoyable visit nonetheless.","4410":"Cafe is expensive for low quality stuff so bring your own lunch.","4411":"Coffee was lovely though.","4412":"I visited the zoo today, 40 years after my previous visit, and genuinely hoped to see a national attraction that housed a great selection of animals in well kept and clean enclosures.","4413":"Instead, I found a zoo with dirty and tired enclosures and those very few animals that were awake and active (apart from the giraffes) did not look particularly lively or enthused to be there.","4414":"I think the educational benefit of such a zoo has been surpassed by the high quality media that are available to us and that there is absolutely no need to keep such animals encaged in such ageing and dirty facilities.","4415":"It is evident that the financial health of the institution will have been affected by Covid and perhaps now is the time to close the zoo for good and to rehouse the animals into facilities that are more able and capable of looking after them in fit for purpose facilities.","4416":"Visited early January so the weather was a tad fresh however it was dry and well worth a visit.","4417":"The highlight was most definitely the two pandas; they full of personality we were fortunate enough to see them actively wandering around.","4418":"Staff were warm and welcoming on the entrance; engaged with visitors whilst strolling around the zoo.","4419":"The park is vast so plenty to see.","4420":"Visited with granddaughter who wanted to see the sloths - did see one who was asleep in his\/her boxBeautifully clean and everything well kept animalsGood restaurant aimed at kidsDownside built on a hill so real hard walking","4421":"I have wanted to visit this zoo purely for the pandas for such a long time and it did not disappoint.","4422":"We planned around this, went straight to the pandas so that we could go back again later.","4423":"However, the highlight turned out to be the baby pygmy hippo!!","4424":"Yes there is a fair bit of walking","4425":"but I expect that everywhere in Scotland so not at all a problem.","4426":"There was a lot of helpful staff walking around to tell us about the animals and it was really nice to see the zoo making an effort to try and keep visitors noise levels down in certain areas to protect the animals - it didn\u2019t work due to ignorant parents and their children but the effort wasn\u2019t unnoticed.","4427":"If in the area I would visit again.","4428":"Nice to have free parking too.","4429":"Came to Edinburgh from South West England specifically to visit the zoo for the pandas and koalas.","4430":"Lovely selection of unusual animals you don't often find in zoos.","4431":"It did leave me slightly uneasy seeing one of the sun bears and a lion pacing back and forth but there isn't much the zoo can do about that.","4432":"The enclosures seemed stimulating (as much as a zoo enclosure can)!The food in the restaurant was reasonably priced and excellent quality.","4433":"Entered at 10.15 and left at 2.30 so a good day out.","4434":"We did skip a few animals we weren't interested in and went to the pandas, koalas and sun bears twice!","4435":"We didn't expect much visiting so close to Christmas - we expected the cold weather to have the animals less active and for an abundance of school aged children taking over - however it was quite the opposite.","4436":"Such a quiet visiting day meant the animals were very active.","4437":"We have never seen lions to close.. and so active!","4438":"As well as the tigers and pandas - it really was a pleasant surprise and awesome day out.","4439":"Slightly sad the 'wee beasts' was closed as the building is small so impossible to social distance - but the rest of the visit made up for that.*Tip for those who aren't a fan of walking up hills (like we are) walk to the top at the very start then spend the rest of the visit coming down the hill back towards the exit :-)","4440":"Went to the Edinburgh light show tonight as a family of 4 and never felt so let down.","4441":"Lights were nothing special, we completed the walk in 30 minutes and for the amount of money spent it was extremely disappointing.","4442":"I booked this as something special after watching videos from the last few years shows and seeing lots of projection work.","4443":"However, the time and effort put into this years show is not on the same level.","4444":"I understand all money is raised towards the care of the animals but spending \u00a359 for a 30 minutes experience your customers deserve more.","4445":"Really good zoo - arrived early, very quiet, spent ages watching the giant pandas which is the zoo\u2019s main attraction.","4446":"All staff very knowledgable and helpful.","4447":"It is very hilly, some enclosures shut due to covid measures but overall a fun few hours despite the rain.","4448":"We are great fans of the zoo having been members for many years.","4449":"However we attended the Christmas Lights event expecting to see at least some animals!","4450":"Sadly this expectation amounted to a handful of penguins in the dark 30 yards away!","4451":"Please Edinburgh Zoo - make this clear in your marketing.","4452":"It cost us \u00a3120 in entry fees and travel for a walk around a hilly course of lit trees and bushes.","4453":"Some were lovely, such as on the members house, and some a little tacky.","4454":"Entertaining for a five year old, I\u2019m sure - but make it clear please!","4455":"Great day out, large variety of animals and all staff and volunteers were so informative and helpful, a must see if you visit edinburgh","4456":"Visited tonight 19th December 2021.","4457":"Visited to see the Christmas lights, and for the prices it was absolutely terrible.","4458":"A major let down.","4459":"I\u2019ve visited previous years (granted that was lanterns) and it was absolutely brilliant..but for the price paid for tonight it is nothing in comparison.","4460":"I think \u00a318 an adult and & \u00a312 a child was very steep for what it was.","4461":"Granted there\u2019s covid going around an all","4462":"but I\u2019ve never wasted money like it going to an event we were literally in there just before 7.30pm","4463":"and we\u2019re back out just after 8pm.","4464":"I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll rush back in a hurry.","4465":"\"Christmas nights event\" was a complete disappointment.","4466":"Literally just a bunch of lights flung over bushes.","4467":"Complete waste of time and money!","4468":"Mortified that I had planned this for my family to visit.","4469":"Was hoping for a magical experience, especially for the price.","4470":"DO NOT RECOMMEND!","4471":"If you have a pushchair, or you are wheelchair user it\u2019s a maze of hills.","4472":"Badly sign posted, confusing, looks tired and a mess.","4473":"Penguins are cute though so it got 1 star","4474":"Nice place to visit.","4475":"Fairly large car park and opportunity to see the animals.","4476":"Decent gift shop.","4477":"Interesting to see the chimpanzees being fed and opportunity to take some great photos.","4478":"Also can get quite close to some of the animals.","4479":"just nowNEWShame the tigers were pacing back and forth in the same spot constantly, they were not happy at all.","4480":"The lion enclosure with three lion cubs who were the size of adults pretty much was far too small.","4481":"The lion parents (ordering to the signs) had a larger enclosure for the two of them.","4482":"Alot of things were still closed and had benches blocking entrance.","4483":"It was expensive but a good day out for small children.","4484":"We had a lovely day at Edinburgh zoo, we checked the weather and chose a dry day and were lucky to see some sunshine.","4485":"The zoo had plenty of animals to view, and all looked well cared for.","4486":"We saw nearly all of the animals and can\u2019t understand why folk on here are saying they didn\u2019t see many\u2026.open your eyes!!","4487":"We had lunch in the snack cafe and it was fine, soup and a sandwich which was reasonably priced.","4488":"There is also a  resteraunt serving meals if you prefer.","4489":"My favourite bits were the pandas and the chimps.","4490":"The glass on the chimps viewing areas are in need of a good clean!","4491":"Be prepared to walk a lot\u2026We walked about 8 miles but visited some enclosures twice.","4492":"Good day out.","4493":"Would recommend if you are an animal lover.","4494":"Christmas lights were very disappointing.","4495":"Boring for the children, lacking imagination and poor selection of unhealthy food.","4496":"Unfortunately I had booked to take 2 sets of visitors and feel embarrassed taking second group.","4497":"Botanics are in a different league.","4498":"Sent email prior to review but no reply","4499":"So pleased with our visit yesterday- the animals were all wonderful & very well cared for.","4500":"The pandas were a particular highlight.","4501":"All of the staff were very friendly & helpful too.","4502":"5*- would highly recommend a trip!","4503":"It is hilly but that isn\u2019t a problem as the views are incredible!","4504":"The zoo itself is great, my favourite was the monkeys.","4505":"The big let down was so hilly.","4506":"For someone with a chronic illness myself it took alot out of me.","4507":"We walked all the way upto the giraffe food place right and the top of the hill but it was closed which was disappointing.","4508":"The food at penguin place was nice, pricey but to be expected.","4509":"We had the butternut squash soup which went down well with my toddler.","4510":"I wouls visit again but would have to prepare myself for alot of steep hills which was the only down side.","4511":"It was a cold day so alot of animals were hiding.","4512":"We didn't see that much because of the \"treck\" however there was alot to see so nice zoo but location on hills was a let down.","4513":"Totally great for someone fit and healthy tho!","4514":"My daughter really enjoyed it.","4515":"Amazing day at the Zoo, I read the reviews on here before we came which were all negative, but I don\u2019t know why they are because we had the best time ever!","4516":"Lots of animals to see, staff friendly and food in the restaurant really good!","4517":"Thank you guys for an awesome day trip!","4518":"A good variety of animals to see.","4519":"Panda and koalas were great don't see them often.","4520":"Due to covid rules lot of walk throughs were shut.","4521":"Which was bit disappointing.","4522":"As it was cold lot of animals were inside.","4523":"It is very hilly!!!","4524":"Takes gd half day to do.","4525":"Overall - a great day.","4526":"Thought the ticket was decent value.","4527":"Saw nearly all the animals, and went to panda area 3 times - which was well worth it.","4528":"At 10.30 were eating bamboo.","4529":"Second visit not moving at all.","4530":"3rd visit up and moving.","4531":"Saw just about everything else, but did think some of the animal areas could have better views, with some you couldnt get very close to or there were too many bushes.","4532":"It would really benefit from more info at most enclosures.","4533":"Often there was little\/nothing about the individual animals.","4534":"Its nice to know about them - age, etc.","4535":"There was often just limited info on the species.","4536":"Please zoo - add more info!It was a quiet day.","4537":"No penguin parade or keepers talks (to avoid crowds due to covid).","4538":"That was a shame, but was clear on website.","4539":"Also most cafe areas were shut.","4540":"The zoo is VERY hilly, so be aware of that.","4541":"I would recommend a visit and thought price was reasonable.","4542":"And GIANT PANDAS!!!!!!","4543":"So wonderful.","4544":"High on my bucket list was to see a Panda and we decided to do a road trip to try and tick it off my list.","4545":"Not disappointed.","4546":"The zoo is amazing if somewhat steep but you felt so close to all the animals and they all seemed very happy.","4547":"Living on Chester Zoos doorstep we are always apprehensive about other zoos but we truly found this to be amazing.","4548":"The Pandas did not disappoint and are the most amazing creatures to see.","4549":"The koala bears were also a personal highlight as were the monkeys.","4550":"The weather was kind if somewhat cold and being on a hill you did feel the wind but the views are spectacular.","4551":"All staff are friendly and helpful.","4552":"The shop was a little disappointing as I do like to have more personalised Edinburgh Zoo gifts and not animal themed items you could buy anywhere.","4553":"However a cuddly Panda sits proudly on my side as a lovely reminder of our trip along with nearly 300 photos.","4554":"First arrival was good, zoo was easy to get to on the bus and opening at 10am was easy to get through and a good queuing system.","4555":"The zoo itself was not lively at all, very dull experience.","4556":"Pretty much everything was closed, most of the walk throughs of the animals were closed, no shows were on, they didn\u2019t do any penguin walks","4557":"and I barely saw any staff all day.","4558":"All the food stalls were closed there was only the penguin cafe open to the public which by the time we got there for lunch it had barely anything left, we left early as we were hungry and there were no options.","4559":"The animal\u2019s , or should I say lack of had overgrown habitats.","4560":"Some of the animals that were advertised weren\u2019t there and there was a lot of empty habitats.","4561":"The website specifically said that the pandas were best to be seen at 9.30am however their habitat wasn\u2019t open until 10.30 which at that point the pandas weren\u2019t out and you couldn\u2019t see through the glass as it was that dirty.","4562":"The hand sanitiser machines around the zoo didn\u2019t work i tried multiple times but none came out even though the tank was full.","4563":"I was very excited to come and visit the zoo but was very disappointed definitely not worth \u00a320 a ticket!","4564":"The zoo has a lot of potential and with a lot of work could be amazing.","4565":"I enjoyed looking at the Penguins and the monkeys, these were the only animals that the zoo had a lot of, if they weren\u2019t there it would\u2019ve definitely been a lower rating.","4566":"The hills in the zoo are ridiculous it\u2019s a constant incline and a lot of steep hills so bare that in mind.","4567":"Personally I would not recommend this zoo definitely one of the worst ones I\u2019ve been to.","4568":"Great day out, range of animals including the first time I've seen pandas!","4569":"Well maintained & plenty of information about the animals.","4570":"Plenty of play areas prvided for the children with accompanying picnic seating.","4571":"Printed maps with one way system are provided.","4572":"Unfortunately a lot of the toilets are portable ones, rather than buildings.","4573":"Limited selection of Gluten Free options in restaurant only - so would pack a lunch just in case.","4574":"Fantastic day out with our nephew, and was extremely easy to get to by bus from the centre.","4575":"Staff were also very accommodating when we asked to delay our ticket time due to one of our group being late.","4576":"Lovely day and brilliant junior keeper experienceWe had a day out at Edinburgh Zoo for my youngest to do his junior keeper for the day experience.","4577":"We were booked in for the afternoon but arrived first thing to spend the morning doing our own thing.","4578":"Staff at reception were welcoming and friendly and nothing was too much trouble.","4579":"We met Lynsey at 1 pm and huge thank you to her.","4580":"She answered every question from my 10 year old (he had a lot of questions!) and had endless enthusiasm and patience with him.","4581":"He met penguins, lemurs, meerkats, armadillos and a cuscus.","4582":"Now wants to be a zoo keeper!","4583":"Do not visit.","4584":"Went in November.","4585":"The place is Tim down.","4586":"None of the interactive elements are working.","4587":"It\u2019s understaffed.","4588":"The whole exywas massively underwhelming and disappointing.","4589":"Hardly any animals and some enclosures had a single or two hard to see animals.","4590":"Giant panda was accessible but many other walk through were closed to public.","4591":"Absolute rip off","4592":"The zoo has a wide variety of animals, including crowd-pleasers like the giant panda and giraffes.","4593":"We loved the walk-through exhibits for the kangaroos and wallabies, and were pleasantly surprised by the number of animals we saw and how relaxed they generally seemed to be.","4594":"This is likely due to the current travel restrictions and the fact that we went first-thing on a weekday, but it was still a lovely experience.","4595":"A few things are closed, but honestly I think I prefer the quieter experience.","4596":"I have a few minor complaints.","4597":"First, it was absolutely impossible for us to book tickets online as Americans.","4598":"The website wouldn\u2019t accept any of our payment methods, and there is no option to book over the phone.","4599":"We ended up getting a friend to book for us to ensure we wouldn\u2019t have any issues day-of.","4600":"Second, the map and signage in the zoo are a bit confusing.","4601":"The zoo does not provide paper maps, and the large map they provide for you to take a photo is partially obscured by the graphics so the upper corner of the map is blocked.","4602":"There was also a lot of routine maintenance being performed in the morning, which meant a few of the animals were not in their enclosures.","4603":"Some of the exhibits are already closed due to COVID precautions, so it\u2019s a shame we missed more animals because we either had difficulty finding them or they weren\u2019t out.","4604":"We had a great time overall, and I\u2019d definitely recommend this zoo.","4605":"Terrible.","4606":"Worst family day out ever.","4607":"Hardly any animals to be seen and lots of empty enclosures.","4608":"Sorry for being so negative but they really must try harder.","4609":"Absolute rip off.","4610":"Over \u00a370 for a family of 4.  Worth about \u00a35 each max.","4611":"Please get some animals for people to see.","4612":"Don't waste your money, try a decent zoo.","4613":"Gave up trying to find animals after an hour.","4614":"So excited to come and see my first ever panda live!","4615":"We headed for it as soon as we arrived, even though it was the furthest point away in the zoo and all uphill on the way!","4616":"Well worth the 45 minute wait in the queue to see it, despite it being asleep!","4617":"There wasn\u2019t any queueing for rest of the zoo so we were able to get around the rest quite quickly.","4618":"The otters were great fun playing in and out of the water and the pigmy hippo baby was so cute!The zoo is built on a hill and is quite steep in places.","4619":"On the whole a decent experience but food options not great especially given the size of the place.","4620":"Most animals visible and the highlight for us were the squirrel monkeys.","4621":"It is very steep so bare that in mind if you have mobility issues although they do operate a service in a vehicle to take you to the top.","4622":"Good day out even in the rain.","4623":"Giraffes and Pandas are a highlight, and as it was wet the lions were inside","4624":"and you could see them.","4625":"Be aware though that the zoo is built into quite a steep hill, in bad weather it can be a bit of a long day for the less able.","4626":"Amazing zoo, one of the best we have visited and we have been to a few across Europe.","4627":"Well worth visiting.","4628":"We traveled all the way from Cambridge.","4629":"Lovely settings and close enough to Edinburg centre.","4630":"Lots of great animals and the enclosures are really well set so you can see them close enough without disturbing them.","4631":"Great day out for any age.","4632":"Best tip we were given was to start at the top and work our way down the hill.","4633":"Took my nephew to the zoo and the staff were amazing, we took the mobility car up to the top of the hill and the lady driving the car was talking away and telling us facts about the zoo, she asked what animals we were there to see and told us about those specific animals.","4634":"The animals seemed well looked after.","4635":"\u00a361 for four of us to walk round a couple of lights.","4636":"It was the spooktacular evening experience and it was neither spooky nor spectacular.","4637":"My 10 year old daughter was most impressed and normally she loves this sort of stuff.","4638":"The actors (6 in total I believe) were ok but not very funny or scary.","4639":"There was one witch who stood very still and moved slightly, that was poor.","4640":"The other witch and the Wizards were ok.","4641":"Toasting marshmallows for \u00a32.50 a pop was rather steep, come on you've already stung us for \u00a360+ do you need more profits??On the FAQ it said there was half an hour of the tour","4642":"and then we were free to walk around.","4643":"I'd assumed that ment the zoo was open for us to look around, wish we'd just done the zoo instead.","4644":"I'd strongly advise you to avoid the evening lights, it was very disappointing and less than an hour even though we walked round twice.","4645":"Try going to Robin hill on the Isle of Wight if you get a chance and see how it's done properly.","4646":"We really loved how obvious it was that the animals were cared for, they were all so clearly happy and treat well.","4647":"I also couldn\u2019t speak highly enough about the staff - we found everyone we encountered to be helpful, knowledgeable and enthusiastic.","4648":"Unfortunately the map was quite confusing when compared with signs  and this lead to us missing some animals.","4649":"Also a number of food\/drink places weren\u2019t open along the way, which meant we were quite thirsty by the time we reached the top of the hill.","4650":"Amazing day of pandas, giraffes, hippos, kangaroos, koalas and many more.","4651":"Staff where friendly and helpful, clean and well kept public areas and toilets.","4652":"We had a fabulous day at the zoo,we loved seeing the panda's and loved the penguins.","4653":"Well done to all the staff,we had a wonderful day out","4654":"and it was definitely worth travelling up from South Wales to come and visit.","4655":"Having previously booked it was an easy entry with staff eager to help.","4656":"Be prepared for aching legs after this visit due to the zoo being on a steep hill although there are eating areas along with picnic seating available.","4657":"The Pandas are a must see.","4658":"All animals appear to be healthy.","4659":"Some cages have too much foliage so it is hard to spot the animals.","4660":"A very poor chimpanzee house.","4661":"No Elephants, No Reptile House","4662":"Not many animals?","4663":"Maybe visited at the wrong time?However the penguins and bear \u2026 amazing :)","4664":"Very uphill, comfortable shoes are a must.","4665":"Totally unsuitable for anyone with any serious mobility problems.","4666":"Staggeringly inept disability support, landscape very dangerous for mobility impaired.","4667":"They should not be allow any one with mobility problems in.","4668":"The website hugely glosses over the inadequate resources for disabled people.","4669":"Mobility bus stops at 4 not close of day as on website, they don\u2019t tell you this.","4670":"Almost had to call an ambulance to get my dad out of there.","4671":"The walking almost killed him.","4672":"Appalling, we are all traumatised.","4673":"Zoo ok, no where near as good as some.","4674":"Fantastic zoo, great to see the animals so well cared for and to learn about your conservation work.","4675":"Have to say you could look after the humans a little better - when we wanted to eat we found many kiosks closed, eventually found one with no food left and dirty tables.","4676":"I took the very last wrap and staff said no top ups were coming - there was a huge queue behind us so some disappointed people I'm sure.","4677":"By selling more food surely you would raise funds for your cause.","4678":"The zoo was so big with so many different animals to see.","4679":"I recommend going round to them all as each one has something special to see.","4680":"You also cannot miss going to see the giant pandas.","4681":"They may be asleep though but still seeing a giant panda asleep or awake is worth it.","4682":"I would recommend bringing coats and wet wether gear in the appropriate months as the zoo has lots of outside areas.","4683":"Brilliant day out well laid out yes it is a bit of a climb to the hill view but you don't really notice it as you make your way through all of the animalscheeky Sloth making an escape attempt and brilliant staff made it.highly recommended for a day out","4684":"We had a wonderful day and saw loads of animals -  lucky enough to see some getting fed and the new Sloth getting some training for giving medication.","4685":"Very helpful and informative keepers.","4686":"Our only concern was the green \"algae\" all over the Pelican pond.","4687":"Maybe it was due a clean up.","4688":"Booked our tickets the night before for 10am slot ......","4689":"2 x adults........ arrived 9.50 there was a que doors opened 10am we got in very quickly no fuss .","4690":"We were given maps it was easy to navigate the zoo ..... animals all look very healthy ....","4691":"they were all very quiet apart from the lions growling  \ud83d\ude06","4692":"The zoo is on a hill so be prepaired to walk .Take","4693":"it slowley as we did .Well","4694":"worth a day out.","4695":"Loads of parking as there is a large car park which is free at the moment .\u00a322","4696":"each","4697":"but this is a charity","4698":"so you know the money is for the good of the animals .","4699":"Lovely gift shop on your way out too.","4700":"Spent most of the day here today.","4701":"Booked for an early slot at 10.00 because the car park is not so big and found plenty of space.","4702":"NOTE, this zoo has a lot of very steep hills.","4703":"Slow steady pace was a must for us.","4704":"Followed the map around and saw all of the animals (well all that wanted to be seen).Very well laid out well, clean and spacious.","4705":"Plenty of toilets everywhere.","4706":"A very good day out","4707":"and I am not really a fan of zoos.","4708":"A tip - avoid the Grasslands restaurant.","4709":"It is very poor both with food and prices.","4710":"I booked tickets for myself and my 5 year old daughter for the spooktacular Halloween trail, I don't drive so booked a hotel nearby as the trail is on at night and meant to take an hour and a half.","4711":"The tickets cost over \u00a330 and the trail lasted about 30 mins!","4712":"My daughter was bored until we got to the \"witch and wizzards\" who were the best thing about the whole experience!","4713":"Without these 3 actors it's just a bunch of lights in trees and Halloween decorations.","4714":"You can stay in the trail till 9pm but my daughter didn't want to go round it again.","4715":"A really expensive disappointment \ud83d\ude1e","4716":"Don\u2019t bother!","4717":"You will spend most of your day in the queue to get inWe arrived at just before 11 to be met by a queue that stretched around the zoo and carpark.","4718":"It was 1 1\/2 hours just to get in.","4719":"There was no staff to ask assistance from and young old and disabled queued alike.","4720":"There is a pre booked timed ticket system but staff eventually admitted this was utterly pointless.","4721":"You still have to wait in the queue.","4722":"In fact  if the timed ticket system worked you wondered why there was such a colossal queue in the first place.","4723":"Eventually several people banged on the shop window to catch the attention of the staff.","4724":"There were groups who had a limited time frame to visit and simply couldn\u2019t wait any longer - they were told even though they had spent over \u00a370 they couldn\u2019t have a refund as the zoo is a charity (?) - the best they could have was a ticket to come back another day.","4725":"That\u2019s wasn\u2019t much to us - we had flown to Edinburgh for a holiday - we aren\u2019t round the corner to just pop back.","4726":"Overall we were hugely disappointed and shocked at how badly organised the whole zoo entry system was.","4727":"We joined several other groups at the bus stop to go back into the city having just given upIf the zoo wants patrons - relies on entry fees to survive and is as it says an international attraction then it really should get its act together and sort out the entry chaosBut beware if you don\u2019t queue you may loose your money","4728":"Booked tickets at the weekend and had to change my plans (we won't be in the country).","4729":"When asked to visit on a different date, I was told that tickets are non refundable and non transferable.","4730":"What difference does it make?","4731":"This would have been our first visit and unless this is sorted we can't make our trip with our 3 year old son.","4732":"Poor Edinburgh zoo, really poor.","4733":"A great zoo and the animals looked like they were well looked after.","4734":"The food in the local restaurant was also really nice.","4735":"Spooktacularwas areal let down having travelled with family over a hundred miles to see it when my local country psrk event is a better standardVery poor scarecrow pumpkins and very little imagination usedCharacters seemed to be treating us as a bit of a joke just because we had no little children with usFood was no better than you would get at car boot sale and no great choice crepes hot dogs burgers waffles could of done with a hot chocolate stall as Scotland is not the warmest at nightI have booked to do Christmas trail with my sister and really hope it s a better experience as not a cheap ticket","4736":"My wife and I booked tickets mainly to see the panda's as they have always been my wife's favourite animal.","4737":"We went 4 times to see them both and were not disappointed.","4738":"We also got extremely close to the rhino's as they were munching some greenery.","4739":"It is a very long and steep walk round to see as many of the animals as we did but it was well worth the effort.","4740":"There were only a handful that we didn't get to see.","4741":"The staff that we spoke to were very helpful and informative and friendly and are a credit to the zoo.","4742":"We are really hoping that the zoo gets to keep the amazing giant panda's so we can come and see them again next year.","4743":"Other highlights were the giraffes, the penguins, the otters, the pygmy hippos, the sun bears and spotting the red panda's hiding in the trees.","4744":"My wife has waited 44 years to be able to see a panda.","4745":"Thank you for making this happen.","4746":"A very special day for us both.","4747":"We travelled over 370 miles for us to see the panda's and we feel very lucky to have had this experience.","4748":"What a welcome.","4749":"So helpful and organised transport to take us to the top of the Zoo as one of the party has a bad leg.","4750":"Driver was very informative and all staff we met were very helpful and knowledgeable.","4751":"You need to give yourself time as there is lots to do.","4752":"An excellent day out","4753":"Don\u2019t waste your time going to one of the evening events unless you have little kids.","4754":"Myself and my family went to the Spooktacular event, we booked the first slot hoping to catch a glimpse of some of the animals before they went off into their indoor enclosures for the night however all of the viewing areas were blocked off and the viewing windows were all boarded off.","4755":"The website states it\u2019s unlikely you will see any animals but what it fails to tell you is that it is impossible as the only places you can go is the rather short and uninteresting trail, the food carts are very limited on choices of food so don\u2019t go expecting to be able to get any decent sort of food either, not even any hot drinks available.","4756":"All in all we were very disappointed and feel like it should be made clear on the website that access is limited to the trail and nothing else and that you won\u2019t see any animals as they are blocked off.","4757":"We love the zoo, can seem expensive however it\u2019s a whole day out and totally worth it.","4758":"Wee tip there\u2019s a small park just past the tigers that\u2019s not to busy and a great place to stop for a picnic just before going to visit the giraffes","4759":"Party of 9 were visiting family in Scotland and decided it would be lovely to visit the zoo.","4760":"However we were very disappointed.","4761":"Paying nearly \u00a322 to walk around and see very little animals was not ideal.","4762":"Lots of empty cages.","4763":"Our 2 year old party member completely switched off due to lack of animals.","4764":"Very disappointingDidn\u2019t realise or wasn\u2019t advised of such a steep climb to get to the top for grandparents and grandchildren and pram also very limited number of animals though the buildings were impressive very restrictive viewing no reptile house and could barely see the pandas","4765":"Travelled here for my husbands birthday, with family.","4766":"What a lovely, clean and safe place for everyone....especially the animals.","4767":"We had a brilliant day, would highly recommend visiting here.","4768":"Lots of parks, eating establishments and toilets etc.","4769":"Well I visited the Zoo today with my daughter and Wow!","4770":"What a let down!","4771":"I think we saw about 6animals in total!","4772":"Total disappointment.","4773":"Food places were filthy and a cold cup of coffee wasn\u2019t what I wanted!","4774":"Won\u2019t be back!","4775":"I had planned to spend the day at the Zoo but sadly it wasnt to be.","4776":"There does appear to have been some work done during the lockdowns but alot of the areas seem very shabby indeed and some of the pens really dont look appealing but i am sure they must have been passed by someone as suitable.","4777":"The llittle hairy amadilo didnt looked very happy either - i have to say i was rather distressed by watching this little soul desperately trying to escape running round and round in circles not something i would ever want to see.","4778":"The zoo is stuck with basically what its had for decades and is trying to make the best of their space but is way behind other zoos and Park which have more space to offer the animals and are making a better job of it.","4779":"Covid has curtailed alot of the extras like the penguin parade etc bu there are no signs to tell you this or when feeding times etc are - it wouldnt hurt to keep patrons informed.","4780":"As others have state it is very steep in places and does need some care from carers or those with reduced mobility - you would be best with a mobility scooter rather than a wheelchair if possible.","4781":"Got there for opening and marched up the hill (be prepared for hills...so many hills) towards the Pandas...","4782":"Panda's were closed due to Gardeners being in with them, got told it would be half an hour.","4783":"Loitered around as didn't want to tackle that hill again...over an hour later the Pandas were finally let out...","4784":"I wish we were told when we got to the entrance the pandas were closed until later.","4785":"Put a downer on the whole day.","4786":"Lots of exhibits still closed off.","4787":"like walkthroughs and insect house.","4788":"We waited for the bird show...","4789":"it got cancelled but no one actually came to the show to tell us that!","4790":"We just never got let in.","4791":"Very expensive for not much happening.","4792":"The penguins were great though, really enjoyed that section.","4793":"My husband and I visited on 25 September for my birthday as I absolutely adore the Zoo and he hadn't been before.","4794":"We had a fantastic day out, the weather was perfect and we saw all the animals, we particularly enjoyed the Lions as one of them was prowling round the enclosure roaring loudly for his siblings, that made my day.","4795":"The new giraffe area is brilliant, we brave the hill twice to see them.","4796":"Will be back again once things are less \"Covidy\" so that we can see the living links area and a few other places that were not open.","4797":"We had a lovely day we had access to all the animals and especially loved the penguins and chimpanzees There were plenty of seats and areas to buy food and or picnic all around the site It is on a hill and I have mobility issues but managed to get around but it is tiring and very steep","4798":"Located within easy access of city centre, zoo focuses heavily on the giant pandas but has a lot of other animals to see \u2013 esp liked the red pandas \u2013 lucky to see both pandas actually eating and moving.","4799":"Most enclosures were well designed with lots of info about presentation and breeding programmes.","4800":"Could do with a slight update on maps and signage within park as got lost a couple of times.","4801":"Only downside is that it is located on a very steep hill but walk to the top is worthwhile","4802":"Great to finally visit the Zoo having originally booked my Penguin Magic Moment about 20 months ago, pre-Covid lockdown.","4803":"Welcome was spot-on","4804":"and we were provided with a locker and given directions and helpful hints as to how to navigate the Zoo, which is constructed on a hillside.","4805":"Weather was sunny and we spent several hours exploring the Zoo.","4806":"Obviously the Penguin Experience was the highlight, well-organised and wonderful to have the opportunity to 'meet' the Gentoo Penguins and feed them!","4807":"Plenty of places to sit, rest and take in the views on the way around the Zoo.","4808":"Some animals hard to see, but we enjoyed our day and would love to return.","4809":"I\u2019ve wanted to visit Edinburgh zoo for a long time mainly because they have their giant pandas \ud83d\udc3c .My partner took me here on 20\/09\/2021 for my birthday and I had such a lovely day there.","4810":"There\u2019s so many animals to see, nearly every corner you turn there\u2019s an animal attraction.","4811":"First time seeing the pandas and one was asleep, the other (separate enclosure) was hiding.","4812":"However I returned to their enclosure later on in the day and was thrilled to see Yang Guang awake and munching on Bamboo.","4813":"So many highlights of the day - seeing the giraffes, meerkats & not to mention the cheeky penguins!Worth every penny, would defo recommend for anyone of any age.","4814":"Staff are lovely in the gift shop too.","4815":"My wife and I took our wee boy here for his 3rd birthday on Tuesday 21st September 2021 and we had a great day.","4816":"We booked our tickets online and booked an arrival time for 11.30am.","4817":"The zoo car park had lots of spaces and parking was free.","4818":"This is the first time I've been at Edinburgh zoo for about 6\/7 years and it was great to be back and see new animals and improvements.","4819":"The zoo is very very hilly and I found it hard to walk with our toddler in his buggy at times.","4820":"The zoo was very clean throughout and all the animals seemed well looked after.","4821":"Our favourites were the Rhinos, Penguins and the Sloth!I took lots of great pictures but unfortunately it won't allow me to upload them on here as it says the file size is too large?!We will definitely be back in a couple of years!","4822":"This is a fantastic day out, the animals have a great environment and there is so much to see and do.","4823":"The views of the city is phenomenal.","4824":"The are a few good food options also.","4825":"A great and safe day out for all.","4826":"We paid a first visit to Edinburgh Zoo yesterday and was really surprised how good it was.","4827":"The zoo is very well maintained, and the animals all seem to be in good health with clean habitats.","4828":"It\u2019s a big park with loads of variety to see, we\u2019ll worth a visit.","4829":"Taxi from Princes Street was \u00a310 each way.","4830":"Pros:Clean, lots to see, food and drink prices are reasonableCons:The zoo is situated on a steep hill, so if you have mobility problems you\u2019ll struggle to see everything","4831":"We had a lovely day out here today as a family of 5.","4832":"We are local to Edinburgh but never tire of a wander around everything.","4833":"First time seeing the giraffes and they were stunning.","4834":"Only bad thing was the hot dog stand - \u00a37 for a hot dog!!!","4835":"Amazing zoo\ud83d\ude01..","4836":"well laid out, knowledgeable staff and all enclosures look so green.","4837":"Never seen a zoo with so much greenery for the animals.","4838":"The penguins enclosure was especially good\ud83d\ude01","4839":"Visited here for the afternoon, fab zoo, it\u2019s on a steep hill so parents with prams were struggling, a wheelchair would probably be no better!They now have giraffes which is amazing, we seen the panda, penguins etc!It didn\u2019t feel too crowded which was great not much of a queue to get in, we won\u2019t talk about the booking system for tickets as it was a bit of a nightmare!","4840":"Good gift shop!Would return to this zoo, we love seeing the animals!","4841":"It's a nice zoo and one that really takes the animals needs into consideration, which is the most important thing.","4842":"However, it does mean that many of the animals are nowhere to be seen in there large lovely enclosures, added to the fact that a few exhibits were \"closed for our safety\".","4843":"We were lucky enough to see a Panda though.","4844":"Please be aware that this Zoo is on the side of a steep hill.","4845":"If you have mobility issues this will make it a tough day out.","4846":"We spent an afternoon at the zoo a couple of weeks ago during our stay in Edinburgh.","4847":"We arrived with proper knowledge of the Zoo\u2019s outstanding reputation and were not disappointed.","4848":"A wide range of animals all in very spacious and natural enclosures, it was nice to see.","4849":"The staff at the zoo were all incredibly friendly but It would be remiss of me to not give some special acknowledgment to \u201cChloe\u201d.","4850":"As she was tending to the otters, myself and my girlfriend struck up a light hearted conversation with Chloe.","4851":"This conversion then turned into a very informative, but natural conversation about some of the Zoo\u2019s practices, along with facts and information about the work that the Zoo do in the wild, all over the world, to work towards the safe conservation of numerous species.","4852":"It was very eye opining and gave us a fresh perspective on the actual work Zoo\u2019s can do to preserve and rescue endangered species, contrary to some common (and misguided) beliefs about captivity.","4853":"Oh We thoroughly enjoyed talking to Chloe, she is a wonderful person and a terrific asset to this Zoo, I wish her all the best and thank her for taking the time to talk to us.","4854":"We left Edinburgh zoo not only having had a great afternoon but also with a refreshed outlook on the role that zoos and their staffs can have on the conservation and preservation of wildlife.","4855":"I would recommend visiting and supporting Edinburgh Zoo to anybody visiting the City.","4856":"It was a perfect way to spend an afternoon.","4857":"Thanks","4858":"We pre-booked tickets for 1330.","4859":"Car Park was a bit confusing and quite restricted but we found a place and queued for 10 minutes to get in at our alloted time.","4860":"We didnt get a map and so we had to use those dotted around the Zoo.","4861":"Visitor numbers are restricted but we had to queue for quite a time for the Koalas and the Pandas, but apart from that we never felt crowded, there were plenty of sanitising stations about.","4862":"Toilets had a lot of queues.","4863":"The stars (apart from the Pandas) are the Chimpanzees, the Lions, Tigers and Giraffes and the Penguins.","4864":"Staff are generally friendly and positive.","4865":"The site is very hilly and after a couple of hours it can get quite tiring.","4866":"The food outlets are currently restricted so there were plenty of queues.","4867":"Worth the entrance fee.","4868":"Fantastic family day out ,The place was immaculate , clean and covid measures throughout the resort was super safe and all following the procedures in place .","4869":"My husband and I thoroughly enjoyed our day out at Edinburgh zoo.","4870":"We both said it\u2019s the best zoo we have been to.","4871":"It was clear that the animals were very looked after, happy and the zoo itself was spotless!","4872":"There was such a good range of animals to see.","4873":"I think this is a must place to visit if you are an animal lover and visiting the area.","4874":"Thanks for our wonderful time!","4875":"And we will definitely be returning!","4876":"Fantastic day at the zoo plenty to see and do park was spotless and staff extremely friendly and helpful","4877":"The staff really made this place.","4878":"We had such a lovey welcome on arrival and the keepers around the park were really great, especially the red panda keeper, who was super informative and obviously so passionate about his animals.","4879":"As with older Zoos the animals do not have the optimal space but they all look well cared for and some of them were displaying some interesting behaviour.","4880":"The penguins and giraffes were particular highlights.","4881":"All in all a very enjoyable few hours spent going around there.","4882":"Went with my partner for his birthday.","4883":"Got the x38 bus from the city,  was easy and about 20 mins.","4884":"The zoo is very clean, the animals look well looked after, however if walking is an issue think twice as it\u2019s built on a hill, not that this was an issue for us.","4885":"We saw all the animals, the sun bear a particular favourite, and a lovely volunteer lady gave us information from her little book about there age and how they became to live there.","4886":"We had lunch in the restaurant- a little pricey and lack of Choice, but nice and clean.","4887":"Would recommend","4888":"We had a fabulous day at the zoo.","4889":"It really is a full day experience.","4890":"So many play areas and viewing windows etc for little ones so great for families.","4891":"The zoo is on a very steep hill but we saw vehicles taking some people up who may have needed assistance.","4892":"Booking before hand is a must.","4893":"We went on a Wednesday in September, out with the school holidays and it was sold out.","4894":"Even with our tickets we had to queue 10 minutes to get in.","4895":"There are some food facilities available however they recommend taking a picnic and there is plenty of benches and picnic areas to eat this.","4896":"A must do if you\u2019re in Edinburgh","4897":"Excellent day out with my wife & young son, we all thoroughly enjoyed ourselves weather made it a better experience.","4898":"Be prepared to do alot of uphill walking as almost all of the zoo is on a hill.","4899":"First time visiting the Zoo and was looking forward to seeing everything but especially the Giant Panda.","4900":"For those who have mobility issues the hill is in the main on a steep slope which made getting around difficult, however my rating as not taken this in to account as I should have done more research and if we had known beforehand we wouldn\u2019t have visited.","4901":"The facilities in the zoo were good and there was a wide range of animals to see.","4902":"We particularly enjoyed the areas where you could get close, the Penguins, the Meerkats, the Bears.","4903":"The majority of the other animals were very much in the distance and difficult to see.","4904":"The biggest disappointment was the Giant Panda, after an extremely difficult walk up a very steep hill we were told one of the Panda\u2019s was locked away and the other one was asleep well away from the viewing areas, oh and not forgetting the ignorant visitors just standing blocking the view waiting in hope that the Panda woke up and actually moved.","4905":"Not a good visit and not one we will be repeating anytime.","4906":"The day was great, animals are all well cared for and you can tell.","4907":"Having received a platinum koala adoption for my birthday it included a meet the keeper.","4908":"We met Lorna at the koala enclosure at 4:30 which is when that habitat closes.","4909":"We had the chance to talk to her and view all of the koalas without the hassle of dealing which other guests which made us feel very special.","4910":"I really feel like she went out of her way to make the experience unforgettable and she really knows her stuff.","4911":"She\u2019s an absolute credit to the zoo team!","4912":"Huge thank you to Lorna and the beautiful koalas for making our entire trip to Edinburgh:)","4913":"An excellent zoo with some really great enclosures.","4914":"It is on a steep hill so beware.","4915":"Almost all the animals were asleep.","4916":"It would be nice if feeding times were advertised or an idea when some of the animals might be more active.","4917":"There were no talks or interactions because of covid.","4918":"Food isn't cheap and the meals we tried were very average so bring a packed lunch if on a budget.","4919":"The gift shop has some really good quality, beautiful gifts.","4920":"On our honeymoon to edinburgh, hardly saw any animals, most of the cages are empty and only the basic animals could be seen, just felt that we back tracked which wasted time.","4921":"Amazing zooIt\u2019s huge took me and my girlfriend 4 hours to walk around and see all the animals coming from the north this is easily the best zoo I\u2019ve visited and at \u00a321 it\u2019s a bargain","4922":"We pre-booked tickets for the 10am opening time as we knew we wanted to take our time & spend the full day at the zoo.","4923":"Visitor numbers are restricted so despite there being plenty of people around we never felt rushed or crowded, there were plenty of sanitising stations about.","4924":"We saw pretty much all of the animals (just be patient, be quiet and relax - patience is rewarded!)","4925":"but particular h ighlights were the Pandas which we saw outside tucking into some bamboo and catching a glimpse of the elusive wildcat.","4926":"Watching the penguins and monkeys can't help but leave you with a huge grin and the chimps are simply mind boggling.","4927":"The keepers are wonderful, apologies to the giraffe keeper who indulged the interrogation our daughter subjected him to.","4928":"As mentioned in a lot of other reviews it's hilly so a solid pair of walking shoes is a good idea.","4929":"There were a few food places open, we grabbed ice cream rolls from near the kids play area and some hot food from the shack right up at the hilltop view.","4930":"Both delicious.","4931":"All in all, a fab day.","4932":"Booked tickets in advance as is required to ensure it's Covid-safe but when I got there I found out that it didn't even matter.","4933":"It was packed and the queue had about 100 people in it - without exaggeration.","4934":"As with other zoos, animals can sometimes hide or sleep so you don't get to see them all - which is understandable.","4935":"However with so many people crammed in, when an animal does decide to show, you're not going to get anywhere near it because everyone rushes towards it.","4936":"Again, it's just what happens","4937":"but it makes a joke of the whole advanced ticket booking.","4938":"Some of the enclosures looked very small, and one of the members of staff confirmed that the rhino enclosure for example is too small, and they're looking to expand it in the near future.","4939":"The enclosures with water had very dirty-looking water.","4940":"I enjoy zoos, but those penguins looked miserable.","4941":"Probably wouldn't return for a long time.","4942":"The positive first...","4943":"The zoo has a lovely 'vibe'.","4944":"Nice friendly staff on the way in and around the park, felt 'covid safe', great selection of animals and the enclosures felt quite spacious.","4945":"The view from the top of the zoo is quite stunning...","4946":"The following isn't meant to be negative...just a few observations...","4947":"1.","4948":"The Zoo is on a hill...a big, steep hill...be prepared.2.","4949":"At the entrance, there was a sign saying that limited food facilities were available and that customers might like to bring a picnic.","4950":"A little too late once you are there!","4951":"Having said that, we had no issue finding food.3.","4952":"The viewing areas are hit and miss.","4953":"The enclosures look large but in comparison to other zoos, the viewing areas can be small.","4954":"I imagine that this is down to the layout of the zoo given the hill environment.","4955":"The only disappointing part for us was the number of facilities that were closed due to Covid-19.","4956":"The indoor ones fair enough but the outdoor ones such as the Panda walkway felt more like a staffing excuse than a potential Covid hotspot.","4957":"The zoo may say that the walkway is narrow etc and that a risk exists which is true...but that doesn't stop dozens of people cramming into other areas to watch the key attractions...","4958":"I do understand that this is a very difficult juggling act for the zoo.","4959":"For us, about 1\/2 day felt about right","4960":"but you could easily have spent more.","4961":"I liked the way that the animal sponsors were clearly displayed outside each enclosure - a really nice and clear addition that is often hidden in other zoos.","4962":"Edinburgh Zoo is a one off, not just because of the Pandas but its unique environment.","4963":"Make sure you book in advance, look out for special offers and have a great time!","4964":"This place is very deceptive, we walked in thinking it would be a little city zoo but it stretched back into the hills and opened it to host a variety of animals.","4965":"We climbed to the highest point (500+ft) and the kids struggled at a couple of points but there was lots to see each path we took.","4966":"Huge queue for the giant panda so we didn\u2019t do that bit.","4967":"Giraffes were amazing and the penguins were great fun to watch.","4968":"Plenty of toilets across the entire zoo.","4969":"Limited food, recommend you take a picnic.","4970":"Very family friendly","4971":"Went with older children.","4972":"We saw all the animals were outside, unfortunately many areas were closed.","4973":"There was a wedding on at the time, so we got to see a bagpiper too.","4974":"Our favourite animals were the pandas, koalas and penguins.","4975":"As members of Chester Zoo we visited Edinburgh as part of our staycation holiday this year using the reciprocal zoo entry system.","4976":"Parking was fine and entrance in was quick.","4977":"In comparison to Chester this zoo is a lot smaller but the variety of animals to see is brilliant.","4978":"My favourite, the Koalas, did not disappoint.","4979":"The blonde lady staffing the area was lovely and chatted to us about the bears.","4980":"Chester doesn't have Koalas so it was lovely to see them so close.","4981":"We did see the male panda having a sleep in the bamboo, we went back later","4982":"but he was still in the same place!","4983":"I loved the pygmy hippo and her baby, very cute and again an animal not in Chester which makes visiting this zoo so special.","4984":"We all loved Penguin Rocks.","4985":"I think this was my favourite part.","4986":"You could get so close to the birds and they looked cute and happy under their little sun parasols.","4987":"The zoo keepers had hoses to both keep the enclosure clean and to spray the birds with as it was a hot day, the birds seem to love this.","4988":"I also loved the pelican walk through.","4989":"The birds were huge and so well cared for and literally inches away.","4990":"The zoo was busy but never felt crowded.","4991":"The paths are steep and it did feel like a work out in some parts but the views were fantastic!","4992":"I wouldn't like to have been pushing a  wheelchair around the zoo","4993":"but I seen a little mobility van that you can use to access the steeper areas.","4994":"I wasn't keen on the gender neutral toilets.","4995":"Whilst I'm sure these worked well during the height of covid when people stuck to the 1 family at a time it was a bit dubious when we went.","4996":"My husband was going to use the urinal in what was once a man's loo when a woman walked in with her daughter!","4997":"I don't know whether the main door is lockable to prevent this","4998":"but it does need addressing and people urged to lock the main door.","4999":"The outside catering vans were very expensive \u00a38 for a sausage and chips was daylight robbery so we never bothered.","5000":"Ice creams and drinks were comparable with other tourist attractions so stuck to snacks from the actual zoo kiosks.","5001":"Overall we spent a lovely 3 hours here and would recommend it to others if visiting Edinburgh.","5002":"Our 9 and 12yr old both enjoyed it very much too.","5003":"We had an amazing experience here.","5004":"There were lots of animals that you don\u2019t see at most zoos and it was a really unique experience.","5005":"The penguins were amazing too and it was lovely being able to get such a close and immersive experience.","5006":"Unfortunately, the only thing that let this down was the accessibility.","5007":"I struggle with mobility problems and it was a real struggle to get to the top to see the pandas and the koalas.","5008":"Obviously it\u2019s just nature and nobody\u2019s fault, but I saw plenty of other people with wheelchairs, prams or mobility problems really struggling and often giving up to get to the top.","5009":"A system to help those who need it get to the top would be really beneficial.","5010":"Other than that, a truly fantastic and beautiful day out","5011":"Visited the Zoo on 25th with my little one.","5012":"Spent several hours wondering around looking at all of the animals.","5013":"Staff\/keepers all appeared happy and were more than helpful when asked questions.","5014":"Animals and their enclosures looked to be well kept too and there was plenty that kept us busy throughout the day.","5015":"Pandas, Penguins and Giraffes were a highlight for us.","5016":"Overall a great visit on a sunny day.","5017":"Spent a wonderful 4 hours here even with a few sections understandably closed with covid restrictions to protect the animals.","5018":"The staff were lovely particularly the enthusiastic keeper by the giraffes who was very informative and was a delight to see just how much he loved his job and cared for the animals something that was clear at the zoo as a whole and certainly stood out compared to other zoos visited in the past.","5019":"A great range of animals in a well looked after and maintained zoo a great day out for all!","5020":"Nice afternoon at the zoo.","5021":"It is on a steep hill with the pandas at the top as the main attraction so I would recommend you start there so you don't run out of steam.","5022":"Good range of animals, we particularly enjoyed the penguins and otters as they were very lively- unfortunately a lot of the others were enjoying a siesta and were hard\/impossible to see which obviously can't be helped.","5023":"Nice information boards and well kept zoo.","5024":"Be warned-","5025":"drinks are very expensive though!","5026":"Don't drive to get here- there were long queues as the car park was full.","5027":"We have visited a good few times and decided to get a membership.","5028":"It is great value for money if you plan on visiting a few times a year.","5029":"Lots to see and plenty to keep the wee ones occupied.","5030":"Every visit feels different.the giraffe enclosure was an amazing experience.","5031":"You get very close up!Play areas for kids are great but can get a bit busy at times.","5032":"Find that  wherever you sit, you can still always keep a good eye when they are playing.","5033":"Plenty places to sit with a picnic.","5034":"Enclosures are well kept and animals look happy.","5035":"A must if you have kids when you visit Edinburgh.","5036":"A big variety of animals.","5037":"large enclosures.","5038":"Walking through the zoo feels more like a hike on a small mountain.","5039":"Overall great experience.","5040":"The entire family was thrilled","5041":"My partner and I booked this trip as it is the ultimate destination for any trip-goer and who doesn't love a trip to the zoo?After a few negative reviews read, we were feeling a little uneasy about what our day at Edinburgh Zoo might hold.","5042":"However, I like to think that every person's experience and perspective is different and we were glad that our visit was a spectacular one.","5043":"We headed to the park, just before our 12.30 slot.","5044":"Parking was easy and there was plenty of space.","5045":"We headed to the entrance and was greeted by friendly staff.","5046":"I was disappointed that we were not provided with a paper map and prompted to take a picture of the map with our phone- very difficult to see in sunlight.","5047":"However, nevertheless, we carried on and found the signage easy to follow (to some extent).On your way around the park, you will stumble upon numerous delicious treats.","5048":"We took a visit to 'Penguin Parlour'- the queue was big, but the staff were very efficient with delegating their customers to certain counters, for quick and easy serving.","5049":"In terms of conditions and animals visible, in  only a few areas were there overgrown trees (in a place that required trees, to mimick the animal's natural habitat) and even then, you could still see the animal.","5050":"The chimpanzee exhibit was the only one I found to be  a tad messy and the koala exhibit to be a little bare.","5051":"Overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our trip to Edinburgh Zoo and if venturing back to Edinburgh, we would definitely return.","5052":"Was very impressed with the zoo and the conditions the animals were kept in.","5053":"Large enclosures with plenty of cover if that's what the animal required.","5054":"Only thing that let it down were the staff serving in the on site noodle bar.","5055":"The food was ok","5056":"but they were too busy chatting about their night out, met with sighs whilst being served,and surprise that someone else was waiting to be served, everything seemed like too much trouble and for that alone I've deducted 1 star.","5057":"It's a pity as everyone else (not many) we came into contact with were polite and helpful.","5058":"On the whole we had a great day out.","5059":"I always have mixed feelings about zoos, because of animal welfare and the balance between  keeping the animals happy and making sure they are visible for visitors.","5060":"I thought Edinburgh Zoo got the balance reasonably right.","5061":"Some animals seemed very content - the male giant panda seemed very happy munching on bamboo and hardly moving from his resting place (the female was  not on display and there were whispered rumours that she might be pregnant?).","5062":"The giraffes also were peacefully grazing from their high baskets at the top of the zoo.","5063":"Some of the animals looked less happy - the tiger was pacing very quickly up and down close to the fence, the white faced monkey (?)    came uo to the fence and tried to wee on the spectators .","5064":"It missed though!Not all the animals were immediately visible, and required some patience to spot them.","5065":"There was a member of staff pointing out to people where to search in trees within the wildcat enclosure.","5066":"I  think we eventually got to see most of the animals, although as others have said - the zoo is on a hill and my daughter struggled with getting all the way round","5067":"so we missed the monkeys and the koalas.","5068":"We drove to the zoo, and the car park was crazy!","5069":"It seems to share parking with a hotel, and it was very tight, one-way and very busy!","5070":"Very limited disabled parking too.","5071":"We had a amazing day today.","5072":"Great to get out and visit such a lovely zooFelt really day and loads of space.","5073":"The animal were loving the sun.","5074":"Really recommend and keep u the great work","5075":"So busy, no one trying to distance at all and lack of masks worn, hardly any animal on display, toilets terrible, very disappointed children, lot of money to see not a lot!","5076":"Visiting the zoo was the request of my daughter having requested the opportunity to see the only pandas in the UK.","5077":"Who am I to say no?The bus rides to and from the city center are easy.","5078":"Jump on 31 or 26 or, or, or in Princes street.","5079":"It's \u00a34.50 for 2 adults, 1 child and the same back.","5080":"No return savings here but you can also pay \u00a313.50 and ride the buses all day for no extra cost.","5081":"The bus stop is directly outside and there are ALOT of frequent buses.","5082":"However, I personally didn't find the zoo as satisfying.","5083":"It's not that it does anything wrong.","5084":"It just doesn't feel like it does enough right and admittedly some of which can't be helped.","5085":"My main point is that it is vast and steep.","5086":"Very steep.","5087":"The number of people I heard complaining, taking a rest or as one elderly woman did, simply give up shows that this must be considered if you have prams, wheelchairs, elderly, disabled or other in your group.","5088":"And where are the pandas?","5089":"Yep, at the tip of  the volcano.","5090":"The relaxing chilled day at the zoo I imagined, it was not.","5091":"The last zoo I visited was Berlin zoo 15 years ago.","5092":"My fondest memories are of the Bristol Zoo of old, not the insect exhibition it has now become.","5093":"These memories allowed you to see the animals.","5094":"I completely understand that the polar bears and elephants we used to see bored and tortured walking back and forth in open, in-personal, boring pens are not right.","5095":"But Edinburgh seems to have taken this the other extreme.","5096":"Many \"view\" points were over grown, the tigers could only been \"seen\" through layers and layers of plants and no end of animals although \"there\" were at such a distance I was jealous when I saw several people with binoculars (guess they knew what I wished I knew).Other things seemed unloved.","5097":"There were boards with details on them about the history of Scottish wildlife where you then look through peep holes at, well, nothing.","5098":"Having done so several times I eventually found an outline of a wooden Wolf with details on it that I think suggested they became extinct.","5099":"I couldn't read due to the over grown bushes.","5100":"Was I supposed to see more animals?","5101":"Presumably all now overgrown too?I am 100% not qualified in any animal safety or welfare but the water in several habitats appeared poor.","5102":"\"World class\" filtration system in Penguin Rock did not seem to take care of the molting feathers, the green filth and random red house brick in the water.","5103":"Verses recent experience in Folly Farm where it all seems crystal clean made me think.","5104":"But all animals seemed healthy,The first toilets you come across were port-a-loos, no thanks.","5105":"The second were \"family group\" toilets which meant you locked them behind your \"tribe\" and were male and female accessible.","5106":"The third were unsurprisingly found to have a massive queue for the ladies.","5107":"For a zoo this size, I found this all surprising.","5108":"I know and respect that Edinburgh Zoo read and respond to many Tripadvisor reviews with articulate and passionate responses.","5109":"I want them to know I respect all they do, the research they contribute to and the over heads they face (and therefore the entrance fees they need to charge).","5110":"However I will always post honest reviews and when I break it down to the basics, I don't feel like I had a memorable experience.","5111":"But my daughter saw a panda and had a great time so as a father, that's all that matters right?","5112":"So refreshing to visit a zoo where you can actually see the animals and the enclosures also look good.","5113":"Last visit was to Chester Zoo where more than half the enclosures had no animals in or they were \u2018hidden\u2019.","5114":"Great 4 hours looking at the Giant Panda, Koalas, big cats and giraffes.","5115":"The enclosures were well kept and \u2018show-cased\u2019 the animals so that we saw lions eating meat, Koalas \u2018playing\u2019 together and the Panda eating.","5116":"Positioned up a hill, so not great for elderly or disabled, and toilets on the top were portaloos, so not sure how that works for either of these groups, but otherwise, good access and plenty of great photo points set against a beautiful backdrop of the Scottish mountains.","5117":"Really was a great visit and we would go back again.","5118":"Brilliant day, had a great day at the zoo.","5119":"A lovely zoo with lots to see, some of the things were shut for covid but not many.","5120":"It was on a hillside but nothing too strenuous.","5121":"Really worth a visit.","5122":"Rude staff on reception - ended up walking out - disgusting!","5123":"Zoo was full and we were basically told to get out by a vile little man shouting his mouth off and abusing the customers!","5124":"I pity the animals if that\u2019s how they treat customers!","5125":"A wonderful zoo!Fantastic selection of animals in nice enclosures.","5126":"The chimpanzee exhibit is brilliant and was my favourite.","5127":"The food and drink outlets are all very reasonably priced with options for everyone.","5128":"We spent 5 hours in the zoo!","5129":"Lots to see, do and spaces to take breaks\/rests.","5130":"Just great!","5131":"Keep up the great work.","5132":"So it was rainy and hilly but having spent many a day at Belfast zoo it seemed normal and didn't spoil our fun.","5133":"We read the reviews and we're hesitant but honestly I wish I hadn't worried.","5134":"We got there just before 10 on a Saturday and got parked easily.","5135":"We saw nearly all the animals including the male panda but outside and in.","5136":"We did go to the enclosure 3 times over a five hour period to see if he had moved as was sleeping initially.","5137":"We saw tigers, chimps, lions, tigers, pygmy hippos, koalas, zebra, giraffe to name a few.","5138":"With a 12 and 15 year old it is hard to keep them interested in anything but we all had a fab day.","5139":"We couldn't really pack a picnic at at a hotel and food options were limited so we just had some snacks and then went to the Toby Carvery 5mins away after we had finished to dry off and eat.","5140":"Overall a great experience!","5141":"I have been to Edinburgh Zoo many times and only Chester Zoo comes close for me.","5142":"I love a long walk and enjoy the hills therefore this zoo is perfect for me.","5143":"It really does make it better when you get good weather.","5144":"Animals really don\u2019t go by our timetable or needs so I wish people would stop moaning if there is a particular animal they didn\u2019t manage to see.","5145":"Just enjoy the day out and the experience Edinburgh Zoo provides.","5146":"We did the Armadillo and Friends experience which was fantastic and definitely good value.","5147":"The zoo itself was nice and the animals seemed happy.","5148":"The zoo was super steep so a bit tiring to walk around.","5149":"Got hit with a heavy rain day.","5150":"Had to book in advance so had no choice but to go ahead with it, what a disappointment.","5151":"The rain basically meant  that any animal worth seeing  was hiding and those you could see were swamped by other people, no chance of social distancing there.","5152":"Tried to take some shelter in the penguin cafe but it was a disaster, they had very few tables (all next to each other) and they had moved the bins inside the cafe next to the tables, just adjacent from the toilets, a lovely experience.","5153":"Some of the staff were sporting special face coverings that only went up to the nose.","5154":"Can\u2019t say I would recommend it in the rain, probably better on a good weather day.","5155":"Amazing animals and lots to see, but signage is poor and most paths are way too steep.","5156":"There is a van to assist those with access needs but the entire zoo is up and down constantly - would benefit from some sort of public transport to the top.","5157":"Would love to see occasional adult only days (not evenings) too.","5158":"I don\u2019t really like zoos","5159":"but I know Edinburgh zoo does a lot of good work for the animals they have, the zoo is on a hill so be prepared for some exercise","5160":"and I mean some of those hills take a lot of effort to get up.","5161":"Not sure if it was just us","5162":"but we found the paths a bit confusing and following the map took us a few tries to find some of the animals, might be just us though.","5163":"The animals in the zoo are well looked after and they have some great ones to look at, some hide very well unfortunately but still.","5164":"All in all this was a great place to visit and my wife and I enjoyed it, staff were friendly, zoo was looked after well.","5165":"I had adopted a chimpanzee for my wife\u2019s birthday so we went to see them, they have a great enclosure inside and out.","5166":"I would recommend a visit to the zoo to anyone young or old as long as they can get up n down those hills","5167":"Our visit to Edinburgh was purely based on seeing the pandas at the zoo.","5168":"We\u2019d watch the tv program and my little boy had become obsessed with the pandas.","5169":"We did manage to see one but not the other?","5170":"And this set the standard for the rest of the day.","5171":"Just no information about anything.","5172":"Empty enclosure, not enough signs on them to tell people what they\u2019re meant to be looking for.","5173":"Or where animals were?","5174":"The animals, when they did appear were amazing as you\u2019d expect.","5175":"But the zoo seems generally run down and abit old.","5176":"Thank goodness we bought sandwiches to have a picnic, as vegans\/vegetarian we don\u2019t always have lots of options but \u00a36 for noodles from an overpriced burger van and \u00a35 for icecream rolls??","5177":"Is just extortionate.","5178":"Our favourite part of the day was the talk from the keepers at animal antics who seemed really knowledgeable and clearly cared for the animals there.","5179":"The animals seemed well looked after and happy and it was lovely to have someone to speak to about the chimpanzee and tell us all the names and what was going on.","5180":"Positives, the animals (obviously) negatives, price, lack of signage and information.","5181":"We\u2019d definitely love to visit again, but if you do bring your own food!!!","5182":"Tired, run down and way over priced.","5183":"There are more fast food food stands and play areas than animals!Enclosures are dirty and animals non existent or hidden in a corner.","5184":"If you want to walk round a field with fast food stands then this could be the place for you.","5185":"Wasn\u2019t sure what to expect having read the recent mixed reviews but it was a good day out at the zoo.","5186":"It is on a hill, so does take a bit of effort to get around (but it isn\u2019t that bad).It was busy and there was a big queue first thing - but it moved really quickly to get us in.","5187":"I think I saw a sign saying it was fully booked for the day","5188":"so I guess advance tickets are a must at this time of year.","5189":"There were a few bits that were closed and a couple of enclosures where the animals were hiding from view, but not many.","5190":"All in all, we saw all sorts of amazing animals.","5191":"They all seemed well looked after and in pleasant environments.","5192":"Plenty of food and drink places open.","5193":"Panda was awesome.","5194":"Good value few hours of fun with family.","5195":"Easy taxi ride from old town and taxi rank outside zoo to get back.","5196":"Guess there are other options but this was our choice.","5197":"Very poorly maintained zoo hardly any animals to see most of the staff seamed to walk about doing nothing in particular the paths are too steep and in bad repair the shops are as usual in these kind of place way overpriced","5198":"Fantastic zoo with lots of animals.","5199":"Set on a hill so be prepared for lots of uphill walking.","5200":"Get up to the pandas early if you can or expect to queue to see them.","5201":"The view from the top is amazing.","5202":"We were really lucky and saw most of the animals.","5203":"Kids loved it.","5204":"Fantastic family day out.","5205":"We had an amazing day with friends and family getting to see all the amazing animals.","5206":"Got a bit lost now and again as having the map as a photo on our phones instead of on paper meant we couldn't always see properly.","5207":"For those who are not aware Edinburgh zoo is on a hill and is steep in areas with a lot of walking but I promise between the animals and the views out over Edinburgh it is truly worth it.","5208":"My daughter is 5 and loved having her own camera and taking photos.","5209":"We took a picnic and carried it in with us to save having to go out and in as you have to re-join the queue to get back in to the zoo from car park.","5210":"My highlight was getting to see the giraffes up close it was truly amazing or watching the baby chimpanzee climbing up the rope (the size of an 18inch doll).","5211":"This was a great family day out","5212":"and I will highly recommend to others.","5213":"We brought the grandchildren from Yorkshire because our 10yr old grandson loves pandas.","5214":"Check in was easy and the staff friendly.","5215":"We had an amazing time and saw all the animals (some twice).The first time we saw the panda was from behind the glass but we returned later and saw him out in the open.","5216":"I was amazed at how beautiful the surrounding areas were.","5217":"It was hard to believe we were nearly in the city centre.","5218":"The zoo is very hilly but everyone seemed to be managing alright and the view from the top is stunning.","5219":"Lots of eating places, picnic areas, toilets and play areas for the younger visitors.","5220":"We spent 5 hours there and loved every minute.","5221":"Try ringing try booking over month ago no answer email arrived in edinburgh still no answer arrive to the zoo to be told there sold out for the day honeymoon ruined won't be returning","5222":"Great zoo - definitely worth a visit and highly recommended.","5223":"Parking wasn\u2019t an issue at all despite visiting midday in the school holidays (16\/08\/21) and expecting that we\u2019d need to park elsewhere.","5224":"Lovely setting with lots of greenery and amazing views.","5225":"Mainly well kept, a few enclosures need maintenance but there\u2019s clearly a continuous maintenance and improvement programme ongoing, and the newer enclosures are brilliant.","5226":"So nice to see good food options instead of just deep fried junk for a change, and lots of places to sit and eat\/drink.","5227":"Hilly (of course) but seems perfectly doable for all (plenty of wheelchair users, elderly and very young visitors clearly managing fine) and plenty of seating dotted about and play areas if anyone needs a rest.","5228":"And to top it all off they have pandas!","5229":"We only saw one for a short while through the glass, but still an absolutely breathtaking experience to see these beautiful creatures safe, well and loved.","5230":"\ud83d\udc3c\u2764\ufe0f","5231":"Nice zoo with lots of animals.","5232":"The day was hindered by the covid restrictions - tickets sold out quickly, confusing one-way system in place and the signage could be improved.","5233":"Word of warning - you may have to queue to see the pandas, but it was well managed.","5234":"Travelled as group for 15 with youg children, very hilly zoo, and at times little steep for the young kids,but overall we all enjoyed the visit.","5235":"Enjoyed new additions including Pandas and Giraffes, last visited  zoo 15 years ago so was aware of the hilly  layout.","5236":"Negatives would be some areas of zoo seem little neglected such as old cages that used to house some big cats, also no map provided,so unless you have a smartphone that takes an image of the map from reception,then signs a little difficult to follow.food and drink plentiful outlets , but \u00a32 for canteens a little high.","5237":"Still one ofmy favourite zoos and will return, hopefully now zoo can start to generate some income, some TLC an be applied to certain areas, But overall  everyone enjoyed there day","5238":"First time visiting Edinburgh zoo and it was a fun day out!","5239":"The only down fall was it was very up and down, not ideal for wheelchairs and pushchairs.","5240":"Took us 3 hours to go around and see everything.","5241":"Fun for children and plenty to do!","5242":"I\u2019m a regular at the zoo and took out a membership and I can recommend people to do so, it\u2019s great value for money and helps the zoo care for all the wonderful animals they have also.","5243":"After a difficult year, it\u2019s my favourite \u2018go to place\u2019 and one where I\u2019m guaranteed to smile a lot so I love coming here!","5244":"I never get bored of it.","5245":"My favorite animal in the whole zoo are of course the pandas!","5246":"They are amazing and I\u2019ve managed to get some great pictures of them both, we are very lucky to have them here and hope we can get to keep them a little longer.","5247":"So envious of the keepers working with them!","5248":"There\u2019s a good variety of animals to see.","5249":"The giraffe enclosure is very impressive and has been a good addition.","5250":"Great range of animals and enclosures, from Penguins Rock to the Budongo Trail, from the African Aviary through to the Magic Forest, there really is lots to see!The staff are all so helpful, from the ones as you enter, in the shop and all the keepers have time to answer any questions you have, it\u2019s lovely to see them so passionate about their job and the animals they care for.","5251":"It is quite steep and certainly gives you a work out!!","5252":"We recently visited Edinburgh Zoo for the first time during a family visit to Edinburgh.","5253":"We booked the 10am slot on-line and it was nice and not too busy.","5254":"The animals all looked well cared for and there was a good selection to see.","5255":"Drinks at a cafe were reasonably priced.","5256":"Our favourites were the red panda, giraffes and penguins.","5257":"Unfortunately the white pandas were sleepy and we didn\u2019t get to see them fully.","5258":"Good gift shop on site.","5259":"Would recommend.","5260":"This was our 2nd visit to Edinburgh Zoo, its a lovely well kept Zoo but be prepared as it is set on a hill!","5261":"This does mean you get some fantastic views from the top..","5262":"we started at the top of the Zoo and made our way down throughout the day.","5263":"Our favourites were the Koalas and Giraffes..","5264":"The Zoo has some lovely new enclosures, staff are approachable & knowledgeable.","5265":"Good covid measures in place other than the gift shop which which a bit busy at the end of the day but otherwise fantastic.","5266":"Car park was free, plenty of spaces available when we arrived at 10:30, roads nearby get very busy so allow plenty of time to get there.","5267":"It's a fantastic day out, lots of animals to see, parks to play on, lots of open space.","5268":"More benches for those of us with our own lunches would be fantastic!","5269":"I loved seeing the giraffes and the giant panda and the meerkats and the chimps especially the baby chimp cuteness overload at Edinburgh zoo","5270":"Visited here this evening,on the adult only evening, with my husband.","5271":"I struggled a bit to get around, as lots of the areas are steep, but managed to see the animals I went to see.","5272":"I've been watching the lions, tiger, penguins and koalas on the zoos webcams and have thoroughly enjoyed doing that, but I wanted to see them in the flesh so to speak.","5273":"I did manage to get to see them all, so was very pleased.","5274":"The zoo itself is very large, and no maps were available but lots of signposts around, so was easy enough.","5275":"I'm glad we went, was a lovely few hours out of the city.","5276":"After reading the poor reviews I was a little concerned as to what sort of day we would have.","5277":"Having travelled from Northampton for a stay in Edinburgh as my daughter wanted to see the pandas I was a little apprehensive.","5278":"However we had a great day, we only got to see the male panda but that was amazing in itself.","5279":"We saw lots of other animals too.","5280":"We didn\u2019t experience any queuing or over crowding.","5281":"Yes the zoo is hilly but we were prepared with sensible shoes etc.","5282":"I would definitely recommend.","5283":"Very disappointed.","5284":"We saw hardly any animals!","5285":"You walk miles uphill with very poor signage and then you reach a tatty enclosure with so much undergrowth that you simply have little hope of seeing anything.","5286":"Now I appreciate that animal welfare is a priority and they need to be kept in a suitable environment where they will feel at home and have shelter and privacy.","5287":"Put them back in the wild then.","5288":"If you are going to run a zoo and charge people to come on the basis they will see thousands of animals then you need to make it possible to do so.","5289":"The future of the zoo and valuable research and protection it provides as a result of visitors needs to be balanced better.","5290":"If people can't see anything they won't come and if they don't come then there is no zoo.","5291":"For me this is simply poorly run.","5292":"I have visited plenty of other zoos and wildlife parks here and abroad and seem plenty of examples of well run zoos which understand the commercial importance as well as animal welfare and balance the two far better.","5293":"Whilst I\u2019d been looking forward to our visit, read reviews, followed on Facebook etc, I don\u2019t think I really considered the 2 main problems enough.","5294":"Firstly, parking.","5295":"There is no car park, not really.","5296":"You\u2019d probably need to there by 9am to get parked on site.","5297":"The website gives lots of alternative bus routes, but unless you\u2019re coming from the centre of Edinburgh, not really useful.","5298":"We ended up at a Park & Ride and then rang a cab - at \u00a313 for 5 of us, it wasn\u2019t much more than the bus fare.","5299":"Secondly, it is very steep!!","5300":"As previously mentioned, there isn\u2019t much the zoo can do about this, but more seating would be appreciated, and the one-way system made negotiating the park confusing and meant we missed some areas and didn\u2019t have the energy to go back.","5301":"Whilst I understand the need to make the enclosures as natural as possible, we did seem to pass a lot of apparently empty enclosures.","5302":"We spent a lot of time comparing the zoo to Chester or Yorkshire Wildlife Park and I\u2019m afraid that due to the location, there is no comparison","5303":"We visited here Sunday 8th August, we had booked a 1.30pm slot & after a short que at entrance managed to get in around 1.10pm, staff were friendly.","5304":"We took a paper map from here and worked our way around.","5305":"We enjoyed our visit, we had lunch beforehand and then took snacks\/drinks with us.","5306":"Using the map\/signposts we found our way around and commented on how it didn\u2019t feel crowded.","5307":"We had no problem walking around park (after seeing people complain it\u2019s too hilly!)We had to que to see pandas - only Male one was visible but this had been explained when we joined the que.","5308":"We also queued to see koalas, around 20 mins but worth the wait.","5309":"It started raining heavily around 5pm","5310":"so we decided we\u2019d end our visit earlier than planned only having not seen a few of the animals.","5311":"(Our choice) we exited via the shop.","5312":"I\u2019d recommend a trip here.","5313":"I felt I needed to write this review after reading many other recent reviews.","5314":"We had a wonderful day out with our two children (2&7) last week.","5315":"It was a sunny day and all the tickets had been sold out so it was busy but not overcrowded.","5316":"We had tickets for 12 but we arrived around 11.20 and stood in the queue for 10 minutes and got in at 12.","5317":"The zoo have done their best to put COVID measures in place, however, it\u2019s ultimately up to the public to adhere to these!","5318":"I felt we could keep a distance from others if we wanted to.","5319":"I did see staff washing the outside of enclosure windows where children touch \/ press their faces up against.","5320":"The zoo were honest on their website that certain enclosures \/ areas were closed due to COVID so we knew what to expect when we got there.","5321":"The COVID one way system \/ keeping to the right hand side had absolutely no negative impact on our day.","5322":"In fact, it gave us a better route around the zoo so we managed to see everything!Edinburgh Zoo is built on a hill, there\u2019s no getting around that!","5323":"No matter who complains about it being on a hill, it\u2019s not something that can be changed.","5324":"It\u2019s on quite a large site but it can be a bit tiring.","5325":"We had a pushchair with us but we didn\u2019t find any areas inaccessible.","5326":"I\u2019ve seen reviews with people complaining about empty enclosures or not seeing certain animals.","5327":"We did experience this a few times but this is a zoo with wild animals.","5328":"The staff are not able to ensure that every animals is able to be seen at all times!","5329":"Yes it\u2019s disappointing, but it\u2019s something to be expected with animals that are not trained.","5330":"Last time we visited, we didn\u2019t see the pandas.","5331":"We were disappointed but we didn\u2019t leave negative reviews.","5332":"This time we queued for 30-40 minutes.","5333":"We didn\u2019t see the female but we did see the male.","5334":"There was a queue for the koalas as well.","5335":"We didn\u2019t queue initially but went back at 4.20 and got straight in.","5336":"The new addition of the giraffes were our favourite animals!","5337":"We spent ages up there.","5338":"Enclosures - the only thing I commented on while we were there was the chimps and the fact you struggled to see through the windows.","5339":"However, I did also say to my husband that it would be an impossible job to keep them clean and the chimps were constantly touching them with mucky hands!The rest of the zoo was fine.","5340":"Yes some looked dated but they are working on improving each part.","5341":"The pandas had actually moved to a new enclosure since the last time we visited (3 years ago).Food - Edinburgh zoo actually suggest you take your own picnic as there\u2019s limited food options.","5342":"We did take our own food and drinks and didn\u2019t spend a penny on anything else.","5343":"We sat near the fish and chip van and actually commented that \u00a39 for fish and chips was reasonable at a large attraction as it was \u00a37 back home.","5344":"There\u2019s plenty of places to sit and have lunch and our children particularly liked the giant play areas while we sat and ate.","5345":"We felt it was well worth the money (which was slightly discounted due to COVID) and had a fabulous day out!","5346":"The rain didn\u2019t help our trip today and felt like we hardly saw any animals due to the lack of clear signs to ensure you see everything, just felt that we back tracked which wasted time.","5347":"2500 animals well must have been invisable was very disappointed hardly seen any animals more walking about than anything else walk half a mile to get to an enclosure and cant see anything unreal!Prices are shocking defo not worth the money\u00a32 for a can of juice \u00a37 odds for noodles and salt and chilly chicken the portion was small and defo not worth that could have had a takeaway deliverd for that!","5348":"\u00a39 for a single bit of fish with small amount of chips really disappointed with the full experience today only thing i enjoyed was being out with the family.","5349":"I dont understand why the prices are so high i get that the animals need to be fed but u must be rakeing the money in charging that its disgusting defo should look at lowering the prices of the food and drink no need for thoes prices pay enough to get in should not be charging silly prices for food aswell.","5350":"Visited to see the only Pandas in the U.K. we were lucky to see the make up close the female was elusive.","5351":"The Zoo is very poorly signed especially as there is a one way system due to COVID.","5352":"It is also very hilly with very few benches and rest areas","5353":"There were just far too many people here when we visited.","5354":"We booked a timed entry and I really didn\u2019t expect the crowds we encountered.","5355":"It was impossible to get near to any of the popular animals.","5356":"We eventually left very disappointed, having travelled over 2 hours to visit.","5357":"It was impossible to maintain any social distancing on a very hot day.","5358":"We have all come back feeling poorly the next day and are now self isolating with very sore throats, coughs and blocked noses.","5359":"Hopefully it is not COVID but who knows, we now have to all seek a test.","5360":"The only good point was the staff were very kind and helpful, the rest was a complete waste of money, we didn\u2019t see anything much, so very disappointing made worse by the ridiculous overcrowding.","5361":"I\u2019m hesitant to leave negative reviews when I know zoo\u2019s need the visitor income to improve so I\u2019ll keep it balanced\/ constructive.","5362":"Pro\u2019s:Lovely picnic & play area.","5363":"Giraffe house was modern with amazing views.","5364":"Koalas we\u2019re something different to see & very cute.","5365":"Huge penguin pool with different breeds to see.","5366":"Great gift shop & reasonable prices.","5367":"Con\u2019sSome enclosures needing updating.","5368":"Some enclosures seemed empty.","5369":"Chimpanzee enclosure was dark, dismal & dated.1 hour queue to see pandas & only got a glimpse of her from behind & far away.","5370":"Overall the \u00a370 for a family of 4 was a lot for what we got.","5371":"But I get it\u2019s been a tough year for zoo\u2019s with COVID, overall we enjoyed our day.","5372":"Visited in august 2021 with my boyfriend.","5373":"Enjoyed the visit and there was a wide variety of animals to see!","5374":"Some indoor venues were closed as expected with Covid, therefore a slight reduction in price would be nice","5375":"but I understand the pressures Zoos were under during the lockdowns so understandable not feasible.","5376":"Some areas in need of renovation but overall an enjoyable experience.","5377":"It was my great granny\u2019s birthday and she is an Edinburgh local so we thought the zoo would be a good trip to take the whole family - but we thought wrong.","5378":"We get to the zoo to see a tatty entrance with a huge queue which went very far uphill.","5379":"Already an awful way to start granny\u2019s birthday, considering she only had one leg so had to hop up the hill as we couldn\u2019t push her wheelchair that far.","5380":"After waiting a long time in the queue we enter the zoo to see meerkats crowded by families meaning we had to wait yet again to see animals.","5381":"Most of the animal exhibits were closed, I understand due to COVID this may be the case but there were very few if any animals at the zoo.","5382":"Mostly animals such as goats and birds were present, however when it came to the famous pandas we waited in heat another large queue to view the panda for only a minute, before we were rushed along by the staff.","5383":"Most of the zoo is an uphill walk with very large distances between the animal exhibits.","5384":"You wouldn\u2019t have minded if you got to see the animals, however it was very disappointing to walk such far distances to see an empty cage.","5385":"The one way system should have taken this into account and put up signs to tell us some areas which were closed rather than making the disabled elderly walk such far distances.","5386":"This was not acceptable and I have zero tolerance for behaviour like this.","5387":"The worst part was when my poor granny\u2019s wheelchair hit a bump on the road and she fell out meaning that her prosthetic leg fell off and we were given no help by staff.","5388":"So we had to hold her hand whilst she hobbled to the zoo exit and we left very disappointed with the experience we had.","5389":"I would never recommend a visit to this zoo ever again and would give it zero stars if I could.","5390":"Take a trip to Chester or London if you want a good zoo.","5391":"I am extremely disappointed and I am looking forward to hear why we had such a disastrous experience.","5392":"We arrived excited to see the zoo however it was a terrible disappointment!Firstly, there were barely any animals in the enclosures.","5393":"Most were completely empty!","5394":"They claim to have over 2500 animals but I saw around 10!","5395":"Half of them were goats which I could see outside my garden window!","5396":"Honestly, you will get the basics some giraffes, zebras, penguins and a few monkeys!","5397":"If you\u2019re lucky you might see a meerkat.","5398":"But that\u2019s basically as far as it goes apart from the giant panda which had a long queue.","5399":"Secondly, the walks to each enclosures are very much uphill with long distances between each one.","5400":"Therefore little ones will get tired quickly due to the long walking time.","5401":"Furthermore, although they provide a map the zoo is signposted terrible with the one way system rubbing off and signs leading you to empty enclosures ultimately wasting the whole day.","5402":"Staff were very minimal and therefore useless.","5403":"Overall, the place was tatty and had no atmosphere.","5404":"It was way overpriced for what was to offer.","5405":"And after the overpriced tickets they\u2019re still asking for more donations.","5406":"Great zoo to visit, lots to see.","5407":"We loved the panda\u2019s and koala\u2019s and had to wait about 15\/20 minutes to see them but we\u2019ll worth it.","5408":"The Penguin area was fab.","5409":"There was lots of stops for food at like burger van type places and picnic areas.","5410":"We decided to bring our own picnic & carried it around with us as the zoo is on a very sleep hill so walking back to get the picnic would have been too much.","5411":"There was lockers at the entrance but unsure if they were operational atm.","5412":"There is lots to see so keep checking the maps to make sure you haven\u2019t missed anything and bring plenty to drink as it was a warm day when we visited so with the heat and hill we needed water.","5413":"First time at Edinburgh Zoo and we all had a great day out and would thoroughly recommend.","5414":"The red panda and pandas a highlight.","5415":"Tried to book the night before and didn\u2019t know what to book my partner as, as my carer or just as an adult.","5416":"I even emailed them asking the question.","5417":"Didn\u2019t email me back.","5418":"Went to the zoo, it was completely sold out as well.","5419":"The lady at the ticket desk, Heather, went above and beyond and spoke to her manager and got us in and out my partner under as a carer.","5420":"Had a wonderful day seeing all the beautiful animals.","5421":"As a manual wheelchair person, the pathways are very steep and this wasn\u2019t ideal, but my partner and I managed.","5422":"It was our first time visiting the zoo today and I must admit I wasn't prepared for how steep it is.","5423":"You are climbing all day which I feel makes it very inaccessible for some visitors.","5424":"I myself am 6 months pregnant and although in fit condition found it very heavy going.","5425":"I agree with the other comments about signage...","5426":"at times it was very vague which leads to unnecessary climbing\/walking.","5427":"Having said that we felt entirely safe throughout our visit and the animals were interesting as well as the site being clean and tidy.","5428":"Was great to see Panda's!","5429":"I visited the zoo with close friends who have a young child and it was easy to see some animals however for others it was difficult as they were inside or the foliage was too much.","5430":"I have been to many zoos and I have never had to queue to see an animal, the queue for the pandas was over an hour and there were no staff to direct people as a result the queue was a mess.","5431":"The COVID guidance in place was extremely poor.","5432":"At the start the young lady on the ticket desk went through all the restrictions.","5433":"The one way system was confusing and rubbing off in places.","5434":"Hand sanitising stations were often empty and social distancing was impossible as too many people were allowed to enter.","5435":"I was thoroughly disappointed and probably won't be returning.","5436":"I love animals.","5437":"Zoo is big as you will expect.","5438":"That is good for animals to have a big enclosure.","5439":"Although being situated on the hill can create a feeling of constant climbing which might not be suitable for people with disabilities or walking difficulties.","5440":"Having the golf caddies for hire might solve this issue.","5441":"I have found direction arrows to be to vague to follow in certain places which can create feeling of lost or unnecessary walk especially if there is nothing to see on the end (big uphill walk around Pandas enclosure).","5442":"Food overpriced in my opinion and constant queues for everything, and you might not get want you are waiting for.","5443":"Hand sanitised stations always empty, please remember to take your own, especially these days.","5444":"Although one way system provides some kind of felling of walking in correct direction.","5445":"Visit with small children you might find hard to entertain them if animals are hidden as there is not enough playgrounds for them to have something to bargain with them.","5446":"I would choose Blair drummond safari park instead.","5447":"Unfortunately, I will not be coming back, as is quite expensive and can be tired experience as watch the penguins for hours could be not enough for many.","5448":"Good for the size of zoo but, could have been better layed out route wise because there was times when you went to see some enclosures bit, felt you might miss others so it involves a lot of doubling back on yourself.","5449":"There wasn't a lot of staff about for guidance but, any there was were helpful and knowledgeable about the animals.","5450":"The gift shop is quite good, and not too expensive.","5451":"Too many attractions were closed, which we hadn\u2019t been notified of.","5452":"Difficult to see the animals as everything was overgrown.","5453":"Way too expensive for what it has to offer.","5454":"First time visiting Edinburgh Zoo, with my wife, son and Grand-daughter.","5455":"My son booked ahead of the visit as suggested and we had an entry time of 11.30am.","5456":"The queue was so long that we only got in at 12.10pm, not impressed.","5457":"Social distancing was non-existant, and the entry system was very poor.","5458":"For those of you that don't know, the Zoo is on a steap hill, so be prepared for difficult walks.","5459":"It was well sign-posted and the free map was useful.","5460":"The main attractions, Koalas and Pandas had very long queses which was really disapointing and after waiting for 20 minutes to go into the Koala pens, all I saw was a Koalas bum.","5461":"Then had to queue for refreshments!!","5462":"Most of the enclosueres were very poor, and in need of maintenance, and although the keepers were helpful and engaged, they seemed under stress.","5463":"The number of visitors severely compromised the COVID security, and I think it little wonder that I got pinged by the Covid app a few days after my visit.","5464":"The entry price of \u00a321 per adult seemed very expensive for what was on display.","5465":"Not somewhere I will be rushing back too.","5466":"Loved seeing all animals got up close and saw majority of them definitely recommend to family and friend's will come again in near future","5467":"A bit disappointed with Edinburgh Zoo.","5468":"The place is a bit tired and would benefit from updating in certain areas.","5469":"Roughly half of the enclosures were empty or closed due to Covid restrictions (as is the case with everything in life atm it would seem) which is fair enough but in this case a cheaper admission would be appropriate.","5470":"Adult tickets are grossly overpriced.","5471":"There are plenty of eateries available but all very expensive.","5472":"\u00a35 for a small portion of chips!","5473":"\u00a36 for ice cream rolls!","5474":"Madness!The queues for animal attractions were awful.","5475":"The Pandas and Koala Bears in particular had long waits and I can't help thinking there were too many people granted entry to the Zoo.","5476":"Lastly the signposting is atrocious and mixed in with a preposterous one-way system (Covid again!)","5477":"it's confusing and too easy to miss animal enclosures.","5478":"Scotland is on Covid Level 0","5479":"now and everything is outdoors","5480":"anyway","5481":"so no need for all these restrictions.","5482":"All in all an expensive and mediocre day out.","5483":"I'm sure the staff are all very committed to the care of the animals which is to their credit but if I were to manage a place like this I would be conducting a serious review and overhaul of how the Zoo is run.","5484":"More animals would help too.","5485":"Amazing visit.","5486":"Seen the Hanging Gardens of Babylon, herds of Wildebeest on the Serengeti.","5487":"Some of these reviews like, people expecting animals to get out there and perform cause they paided the admission.","5488":"Had a great day with kids, staff coping will with the restrictions that have been imposed on them and getting on with looking after the animals, all were chatty and polite.","5489":"Thanks for making a great visit guys, look forward to returning in better times.","5490":"It's a nice zoo, go early as parking was full by 12.","5491":"We went early.","5492":"Panada, giraffe \ud83e\udd92 and penguin \ud83d\udc27 are really great.","5493":"Chimps are locked \ud83d\udd12 in gages for research.","5494":"Upsetting \ud83d\ude21 really.","5495":"We're both in our 50s and pretty fit, we found the hills a struggle.","5496":"Some folks pushing wheelchairs with under 5s and over 80s.","5497":"Lot of huffing and puffing.","5498":"Good zooExcellent staffHills terribleParking limited","5499":"We were all disappointed with the zoo - very poor signage which a lot of others were all saying  - the Panda looked very sad and I felt that the enclosure was very small - most of the staff were friendly","5500":"me and my boyfriend came on a trip to edinburgh (mainly for the zoo) and were so disappointed.","5501":"we came to the after hours evening because it sounded like it might have a bit of atmosphere around it and be quite good but i definitely wouldn\u2019t recommend it.there wasn\u2019t much choice for food and drink and the drinks were so overpriced.","5502":"2 double gin lemonades was \u00a322.","5503":"i thought this was ridiculous considering tickets were already \u00a320 per person.we also didn\u2019t get to see a lot of animals, lots of inside bits were closed for the evening.","5504":"there was barely any staff walking around either if anyone had any problems or questions.overall very disappointed and wouldn\u2019t recommend","5505":"Lovely zoo.","5506":"Friendly staff.","5507":"Lots of hills so need to very mobile.","5508":"Had lunch in Grasslands restaurant.","5509":"Absolutely delicious.","5510":"Basic looking but food is very good and reasonably priced.","5511":"The side salad is huge and had a lovely pesto dressing and the cheesy chips are delicious.","5512":"Penguins, Giraffes and the Giant panda were my favourite animals.","5513":"This was by far the worst experience.","5514":"The only tickets available were for 'adult only' evening, which in principle is fine as all other tickets during the day were sold out.","5515":"I was surprised to see beer tents and bars near the entrance plus live music; you don't need to be an animal expert to know this would disturb the animals but I can see why it was there.","5516":"It was a clear distraction to the fact that most of the enclosures were empty, animals nowhere to be seen and most of the viewpoints to see them were closed.","5517":"I paid over \u00a340 for tickets and I'm absolutely seething.","5518":"I will not be back here again; it was thoroughly disappointing.","5519":"I came to the zoo to see and admire the animals, not drink to drink overpriced alcohol.","5520":"Wow, 1 of the best zoos ever.","5521":"Thoroughly enjoyed it, beautiful animals, loved the panda and koalas, the giraffes  and penguins were brilliant.","5522":"Really busy due to holiday time but because of restrictions wasn't oppressive.","5523":"Luckily I knew about the slopes etc, did see people struggle though.","5524":"Highly recommend it....","5525":"It is a great day out, we got there for the opening (we booked a 10 am entry) and we got to see all the animals - that wanted to be seen (the red pandas and Scottish wildcats were not playing ball !!)","5526":".We saw the giant pandas easily as we went pretty much straight there - he was being a bit of a showman eating his bamboo in full sight of the guests.","5527":"We took a picnic but topped it up with takeaway chips - really nice cheesy chips!We would have liked to be able to refill water bottles at the top of the hill rather than just next to the meerkats - as we only found that refill point while we were getting ready to leave.","5528":"It could have been useful to have a note saying how many are in each habitat so you know how many furry bodies to be looking out for.","5529":"Also possibly numbering the habitats so you could tick off each habitat to make sure you don't miss any.","5530":"It\u2019s been years since I\u2019ve been to this zoo.","5531":"I always had nightmares when I was young regarding the sheer uphill walk to get to the top before zig zagging down  again.","5532":"What a brilliantly kept zoo this is.","5533":"The staff have obviously been extremely busy through the lockdown as the animals all look like they are in top class condition.","5534":"There is plenty to see and there is also play parks for the kids.","5535":"We spent the whole day on here and we still never saw everything but we all loved it and the staff were great.","5536":"Only bad thing was the young chap in the ice cream shack near the penguins.","5537":"Clearly doesn\u2019t want to work there so beat get another wee job son.","5538":"It didn\u2019t spoil our visit and the ice cream was lovely.","5539":"Well worth a visit back.","5540":"We had a good day however things could be improved.","5541":"The one way system in place (due to Covid) created more traffic of people abs more queues.","5542":"We queued for 45 mins to see the giant pandas and then didn\u2019t see them very well at all (photo shows best poor view).","5543":"I feel the 1 way system caused the panda wait time.","5544":"Signage was poor.","5545":"There was a few occasions where it wasn\u2019t clear which way to go.","5546":"The map was ok but not brilliant.","5547":"Can\u2019t avoid the hills but again had there been no 1 way system it would be better to go straight to the top of the park and head downwards.","5548":"Some of the paths are very very steep.","5549":"Also, like most places, the cost of food and drinks was ridiculous.","5550":"\u00a32.65 for a can of pop - that\u2019s just pure greed.","5551":"We had a good day","5552":"but I was expecting more.","5553":"Not sure I would return.","5554":"A beautiful zoo with the main attraction, 'The Pandas'.","5555":"The staff were supportive, implemented social distancing and were happy to help.","5556":"If your not a fan of walking up slight inclines, then you should be warned.","5557":"The  walking pace is slow and you will need often breaks to rest.","5558":"Take your most comfortablist walking shoes, wear clothing where you can add or remove layers and of course its Scotland, remember your weather proof jacket.","5559":"We went for the star attractions, the Pandas and were not disappointed.","5560":"Amazing Chimpanzee and penguin enclosures.","5561":"If your travelling from Edingburgh to the Zoo, get an uber for the cheapest method of travel.","5562":"Queuing due to covid-19 should be taken into account.","5563":"My overall review is a great zoo, lovely collection of animals,  take a packed launch and make the day of it.","5564":"This will support distancing, break up the inclines and help you enjoy your day.","5565":"Thank you Edingburgh Zoo.","5566":"A lovely day out.","5567":"All animals seem content and have plenty of space.","5568":"One way system a little confusing.","5569":"Other than that all well done and very covid safe.","5570":"I can't help but compare this zoo to my local Colchester zoo, and Edinburgh zoo just felt very underwhelming.","5571":"Currently no talks or shows, food v expensive, tired decor.","5572":"There are fewer animals (e.g no elephants, leopards or cheetahs, sealions), the viewing space to see them is much smaller than Colchester, and the glass was so mucky could barely see in!","5573":"The queue for the pandas was long and unfortunately due to some other selfish visitors (I do feel the staff could have encouraged them to move along) the pandas went out back out of view by the time we and many other families got to the viewing areas.","5574":"We could only book an afternoon slot but there is no price reduction, and we ended up missing out on the koalas due to the panda queues.","5575":"We were very disappointed indeed with our visit to the zoo and this was totally down to the zoo keepers responsible for the pandas.","5576":"The primary reason for our long weekend in Edinburgh was to visit the zoo and view the beautiful giant pandas in \u2018person\u2019 so to speak.","5577":"This was my long awaited birthday treat..","5578":"It was the most awful rainy day which could not be helped and we couldn\u2019t have avoided because you are forced to pre-book: so cannot just make up your mind to visit on spec.","5579":"This meant that the sensible animals did not come out of their warm, dry shelters and we missed many the first\/second time around.","5580":"Again this cannot be helped - the animals don\u2019t like to be out in the rain just like us humans it seems (and I don\u2019t blame them..).","5581":"The exceptions were obvious creatures like the penguins.","5582":"Since I really wanted to see the pandas properly awake (we stayed all day - from 11.00 to 17.30 - and it was a long day due to the relentless rain and very few places to shelter) we made the long trek up the hill (the pandas are at the top of the zoo) three times!We deliberately left our last attempt at seeing them awake (they\u2019d been sleeping both previous visits) until as late as possible.","5583":"So we arrived at their enclosure at 17.10 and to my great delight Sunshine (the large male panda) was awake and sitting up eating.","5584":"He unfortunately had his back to the viewing window but we hoped that he would turn around at some point.","5585":"And we were prepared to wait - we\u2019d tried 3 times to see them and we still had 50 minutes until the zoo closed.","5586":"Then suddenly Sunshine got up and disappeared through the door at the back of the enclosure - it had just been opened and he was away.","5587":"Needless to say he didn\u2019t come back out.","5588":"We went around the corner to see what had prompted him and sure enough the golfing buggy that the zoo keepers use to get around: was there; we waited until they appeared and asked why Sunshine had gone out of the enclosure.","5589":"We didn\u2019t really get a proper answer to that simple question - why not?Was it simply because the zoo keeper had opened the back door and the animal knows that that means he can go into the back and settle for the night?","5590":"Of course it was!It was only 17.10 for goodness sake!","5591":"A whole 50 minutes before the zoo actually closes to the public.","5592":"One of them had started to wash the main viewing window of the enclosure: do they ensure that the pandas are not present when this is done as it too: might spook them?One of the keepers volunteered that the female panda \u2018had been out feeding quite a lot during the day - right in front of the window\u2019..","5593":"Well we weren\u2019t there then!If we had stayed there all day long: as in keep joining the lengthy queues and trying again and again until we managed to come across the creature\/s actually awake: we would have seen nothing else in the zoo.","5594":"So we tried to space out the 3 visits we made evenly over the long day.","5595":"We got various spurious answers from both of the keepers: \u2018it rained all day and the animal would want to stay indoors\u2019 (we know that - we were out in it all day long!); \u2018there was thunder yesterday\u2019 (she meant that it spooked the animal and I wouldn\u2019t disagree with that but it wasn\u2019t relevant to my questions); the animal can \u2018do what it likes\u2019 and \u2018it might come back into the enclosure if it wants to\u2019 (they knew fine","5596":"well that the creature is conditioned to settle down when certain things are done); \u2018they have to start settling the animals before 18.00 - it tells you that in the details\u2019..","5597":"No it doesn\u2019t say that in the details!It does mention that \u2018some animal houses start closing 30 minutes before the zoo closes\u2019.","5598":"It specified a couple but did not mention the pandas and anyway - we are talking about 50 MINUTES before the zoo closed!","5599":"And the creature went off to settle immediately that the door was opened..","5600":"The male keeper informed us that it said \u2018somewhere in reception that the pandas might be shut up earlier\u2019 - well all we can say is that we didn\u2019t see it when we arrived!","5601":"The reception is full of materials and signs: good luck to anyone walking through and reading everything they pass.","5602":"It was also busy with people when we came through it.","5603":"I cannot tell you how disappointed I am: I have waited years to be able to look into the face of one of the most exquisite creatures on earth and due to being closed up far too early; we were totally unnecessarily denied that.","5604":"And we really tried to achieve that: most people might have just tried once or twice.","5605":"Our weekend cost almost \u00a3500 to finance: so it\u2019s unlikely we will repeat the experience.","5606":"It pains me to say anything negative about an organisation that is caring for exotic and\/or endangered creatures because I know that our entrance fees go to paying for their care.","5607":"But I feel strongly that the management of the zoo need to be aware of how it is being maintained and perhaps they and the zoo keepers themselves: need to be reminded DAILY of how rare and precious (and expensive overall!)","5608":"the visits can be to members of the public.","5609":"Been a long time since visit to Zoo and probably not need to visit again.","5610":"Good play areas for children.","5611":"Many areas empty of animals.","5612":"No elephants\/no polar bears \/ no seals we could go on..................","5613":"Penguins entertaining and giraffes a delight.","5614":"Zoo keepers in penguin areas obviously love their job.","5615":"Booked a spot for 12PM and spent well over 5 hours there, so I recommend you make it a day trip.","5616":"Queue wasn't bad on the day we went (other than the gift shop).","5617":"One of the best zoos I've been to.","5618":"Considering the situation, I was pleasently surprised to find out that almost every indoor attraction was opened.","5619":"Worth the time and had a lot of fun seeing the animals, especially the pandas.","5620":"As its school holidays decided on a day trip to Edinburgh and booked the zoo for 1.30.We arrived before 1.30 and found the queue was massive so decided to join the end thinking by the time we get to the front will be our time slot next nope the queue went down quickly tickets on phone scanned and let us in told about the 1 way system etc got in a was clear social distancing went right out the window.","5621":"I decided to keep my mask on throughout the visit as did my family it was like others thought covid was gone and was like a normal dayThought the whole point of booking was so that only a select few for that time slot were allowed inThe animals on the other hand were good think we missed a couple due to the heat etcOnly thing that spoiled it was just the lack of social distancing and staff members controlling this (in one of the enclosures indoors a staff member did say about social distancing but went on deaf ears to some people)","5622":"Very very rude staff , as a tourist and a respected man everywhere i go","5623":"i Find the level of 98 out of 100 OF THE STAFF BEING VERY RUDE , hope that you are not rude with animals x(x( try in youre visit not to have contact with staff because you risk to see those faces insulting you just looking at you RUDE RUDE RUDE STAFF","5624":"We were visiting the area and decided to book tickets in advance to visit the zoo.","5625":"On arrival the queue was absolutely massive, we had booked arrival time for 11am, we arrived at 10:50am but didn\u2019t actually get into the zoo until 11:25.","5626":"Not sure what the point of booking arrival times if you\u2019re going to have to stand in a massive queue anyway, seems pointless booking in advance.","5627":"Once in the zoo it was quite disappointing, a lot of enclosures empty and the one way system I felt meant we missed out on seeing some animals.","5628":"Enclosures looked dirty, the glass on some were so smudged and dirty you couldn\u2019t barely see in (I understand that they\u2019re animals and going to be dirty but what\u2019s the point in it being a zoo if you\u2019re unable to see in).","5629":"We got 2 ice creams and 2 waters from one of the kiosks this totalled \u00a39 which seemed a bit extreme.","5630":"We we\u2019re heading out the gate by 13:30.","5631":"I felt the ticket prices were very high for what was actually in the zoo.","5632":"We visited Blackpool zoo not long ago and this seemed much more organised and more animals to see.","5633":"With the COVID restrictions in place, husband was expecting more 'experiences' to be closed, but surprisingly not.","5634":"The place is HUGE, so be prepared to do a lot of walking.","5635":"The path to the Giant Pandas involve trudging up a steep slope, and it reminded me of how unfit I am.","5636":"\ud83d\ude05We managed to see the giraffes too, which was Joshua's favourite!There are food vans throughout the zoo, but even they recommend you bringing your own picnic food.","5637":"In spite of the rain, we thoroughly enjoyed our day at the zoo!","5638":"First time visiting here in almost 3 years.","5639":"Unfortunately it had gone downhill drastically in the period of 2013 - 2018.","5640":"So much so we simply stopped visiting.","5641":"Due to not getting away during the pandemic, we decided to give it another go and we are glad we did.","5642":"A vast improvement in the 3 years since we last came.","5643":"More animals to be seen this time around.","5644":"Food outlets are much improved.","5645":"There just seems to have been a big overhaul of late having been stagnant for so long.","5646":"We will now be regular visitors once again.","5647":"Ps","5648":"The Giraffes are simply incredible","5649":"We have not been to Edinburgh Zoo for a few years and booked it for my daughters birthday.","5650":"We had a brilliant day, the zoo has had some really great exhibit upgrades and new additions since we last visited and has improved it massively.","5651":"The new Giraffe area was a particular favourite, as well as the Pandas, Red Pandas and the Penguins.","5652":"We had a great day out and will be back.","5653":"A very pleasant day out.","5654":"The route marking due to Covid was really great, we usually jump from one must-see animal to the next.","5655":"Following the arrows meant that we saw every animal in the zoo.","5656":"It was wonderful","5657":"This was our most enjoyable thing we did in edinburgh.","5658":"It was absolutely chucking it down with rain the whole time unfortunately so we didnt get the full experience but would definitely return in future.","5659":"Kids loved it (4&7)  chimps and pandas were a favourite all round.","5660":"Obviously lots of walking and hills involved.","5661":"On our exit the queues were huge to enter and car park was totally full so would recommend going first thing as we got in at 10am no problem.","5662":"Gift shop was resonably priced i felt.","5663":"Hope to be back again","5664":"World class experience, keepers made it fantastic.","5665":"From knowledgeable input to keep folks on the straight and narrow (in the nicest possible way) best I have come across in a long time!!","5666":"Great visit staff very knowledgeable and friendly.","5667":"Felt safe with the social distancing procedures one way systems etc.","5668":"Hopefully get the keeper talks back soon and it is Brilliant to see Giraffes back in the zoo again with a great enclosure to go along with the new up to date enclosures you guys have done, hopefully the first of many new arrivals to come as there is a lot of space available for new enclosures for example the African plains, big green space next door to the giraffe enclosure, and green space at the vicunnas to name a few :).","5669":"Also could do with a new rainforest house which you mentioned in your previous big 5 campaign.","5670":"Hopefully you guys progress with the big 5 campaign you were looking at before the zoo closed because of lockdown.","5671":"As it would be good to see more emperor penguins and them having their own enclosure with them being the zoos mascot.","5672":"The zoo itself is wonderful!There are so many animals to see, although the Tiger seemed a bit sad, he was pacing up and down the whole time.","5673":"Be aware that the zoo is very hilly, and it\u2019s a tough walk at times.","5674":"Be prepared to walk a lot, and maybe reconsider taking a pushchair.","5675":"We did have to queue to get in, despite having pre-booked tickets.","5676":"We also queued a bit for the panda exhibit but this was 100% worth it.","5677":"I wish there had been more information signs for the animals, I like to read about them.","5678":"The giraffe enclosure has recently been added and this was incredible!I think maybe the addition of a zoo train, or something to get you from one side to the other would be great.","5679":"Do keep an eye out for the special grey\/white penguin!","5680":"We had a very wet evening at the zoo.","5681":"The rain isn't anyone's fault, so can't really be marked down for that.","5682":"We booked an evening because it would be adult only, so less busy with kids running around etc.","5683":"However, we didn't really factor in that this would actually mean drunk adults.","5684":"Thankfully we didn't run into too many drunken groups, but there were some, being quite typical drunk people: loud, boisterous, sweary.","5685":"And I think, worst of all, not bothering is the slightest with social distancing.","5686":"Actually, this was not specifically a drunk-people problem.","5687":"Lots of people queuing in close crowds round viewing windows etc.","5688":"Made us pretty uncomfortable.","5689":"There didn't seem to be many staff on hand.","5690":"One very helpful member of staff by the penguins, who was knowledgeable and informative, but otherwise, we didn't see anyone all the way round.","5691":"Some animal exhibitions better than others.","5692":"The penguins were great, and so were the rhinos, despite lots of people crowding round.","5693":"We didn't  even bother going to the viewing platform for the giraffes, as there were just so many people crowded round.","5694":"We were also totally unable to see any lions, tigers and zebras in their enclosures.","5695":"Its understandable that some animals might be hiding\/not visible\/indoors, but this felt quite disappointing that it was so many.","5696":"Plus, a lot of the indoor areas for viewing were closed off.","5697":"We were also disappointed by the lack of places to sit down, particularly sheltered areas.","5698":"With the rain,  we were looking for cover, but couldn't really find any.","5699":"Signs around the place were very informative.","5700":"Paths and scenery well maintained.","5701":"The one way systems were a little strange.","5702":"the signs were all \"keep right\" rather than \"keep lett\", which was a bit odd.","5703":"But, no one seemed to want to stick to the system anyway.","5704":"Overall, this trip wasn't too bad, but could have been better,with more distancing, less drunk people, more seating\/sheltered areas, and not having viewing areas closed.","5705":"Edinburgh Zoo is another excellent UK zoo with a huge variety of animals.","5706":"The enclosures were large and lovely, the animals appeared to be happy and viewing them was easy.","5707":"This was particularly the case for the giraffes who are new to the zoo and housed in an awesome enclosure that allows you to get up close and personal!","5708":"Fantastic zoo - everything you would expect, plus the added bonus of pandas!","5709":"So amazing to see these for the first time.","5710":"The zoo has a one and two way system in place to assist with social distancing.","5711":"Some areas of the zoo have signs to say that only one group are allowed there at a time, which a lot of guests were ignoring and no one seemed to be enforcing this at the time (rhinos and tigers in particular).","5712":"Otherwise an excellent experience though.","5713":"Very hilly!","5714":"Arrived early about 9.45 and was pleased to see the members gate opening at 10. 00We had the kids with us and we were pleased to find the Panda in its large outdoor enclosure , There has been quite a change around with the new Giraffe enclosure         ( excellent ).","5715":"We had a great time even with the disappearance of the Leopards and panthers ,the Lions and Tiger are still there ,the Koalas were active and most of the  usual animals .The bird aviary was closed and is a work in progress .","5716":"Going in at opening time means you miss the crowds .","5717":"At the moment until they fully reopen with the rest of the animals it is not great value for money.","5718":"For this reason ans the following report on the toilets in the car park I have marked it down as poor.","5719":"I would like to  point out that the Toilets at the top of the car park are now unisex which means the urinals have been taken out .","5720":"Which is the moment I found out the cubicles are not fit for purpose .","5721":"The only way I could get in was to squeeze tightly to the left and step over the toilet to shut the door .","5722":"My wife informs me that the ladies loos were always tight to get into .I found it difficult and I am 16 stone anyone larger will have to sit down with the door open .","5723":"This is ludicrous in this day and age .","5724":"For heaven sake Edinburgh Zoo get this sorted ,you have people from all over the world visiting ,what an impression to make !","5725":"It has been a while since we last visited Edinburgh Zoo.","5726":"We pre-booked to start at 11:30.","5727":"Edinburgh Zoo has introduced a partial one way system with COVID-19 and it is working well.","5728":"Most of the animals were out and as per normal there were some really outstanding displays.","5729":"A great three hours spent including some very good gourmet hot dogs.","5730":"Went here today really enjoyed the day would definately recommend.","5731":"Plenty of animals to see can easily spend a good few hour here .","5732":"Pre booked and arrival time of 10am.","5733":"We spent an enjoyable few hours wandering round the zoo.","5734":"The keepers were friendly and informative.","5735":"Loved the koalas giraffes meerkats to name a few of the animals we saw.","5736":"Some areas were closed for covid reasons but this did not impact our visit to much.","5737":"It is very hilly so be prepared for this.","5738":"Edinburgh zoo has a wide variety of animals.","5739":"Unfortunately not all areas of the zoo were accessible because of corona virus.","5740":"Still a lovely experience.","5741":"Great visit at a must see for visitors to Edinburgh.","5742":"In an ideal world, we wouldn't need zoos, however its comforting to see when a zoo is done right.","5743":"The visit was fun, educational and a great way to spend a day in the city.","5744":"The safety procedures in place are also carried out well for a safe visit that doesn't feel overcrowded.","5745":"There were a couple of short queues for popular animal exhibits and they were in the process of upgrading the giraffe area.","5746":"The zoo is on a steep hill at points so this may be an issue for anyone with walking difficulties, however I believe that there is a shuttle service that will assist persons getting to the top of the hill.","5747":"Brilliant visit to the zoo today.","5748":"It\u2019s had a lot of work done to it since we were last there.","5749":"The new monkey \/ chimpanzee areas are great and once the interactive stuff gets put back on these will be brilliant.","5750":"The new walkthrough areas and giraffe enclosure are beautifully themed.","5751":"Really good job done on these as well as the kids play parks.","5752":"Only negative was the toilets.","5753":"I hope the blue portaloo blocks are just temporary, they\u2019re awful.","5754":"It\u2019s great that there\u2019s more toilets around the park than before but we really need to get proper toilet blocks installed.","5755":"The ones up by the giraffe house are nice and they look great themed with that area.","5756":"Shout out to the keeper in the chimpanzee area,  her name started with a Y but I didn\u2019t catch her badge properly.","5757":"She was lovely, really helpful and informative.","5758":"Took time with my daughter to point out the chimps, their names and the baby!","5759":"She told us what to look out for throughout the park too.","5760":"I can imagine lots of kids wanting to be zoo keepers after interacting with her.","5761":"I have been to Edinburgh Zoo on previous occasions and have always loved the experience but this visit was very different.","5762":"The tickets were very expensive and considering all the many closures throughout the zoo, they should have been reduced.","5763":"No monkey house, no reptile house, no giraffes no penguin march and the few animals that were still allowed to be seen actually couldn't really be seen as you weren't allowed in most of the viewing areas!","5764":"I would give it a miss.","5765":"Over priced and certainly not worth the hassle queuing.","5766":"AND there used to be a bus to take you from the bottom to the top (all up hill) and back again but that wasn't running either.","5767":"So, if you're at all unfit, then definitely give it a miss - lot's of people were complaining about this and didn't bother going up.","5768":"I'm only sorry that we wasted our time and energy hiking up because there was very little to see.","5769":"I won't be going back to Edinburgh Zoo.","5770":"It's not worth the money and the emphasis is very much on one to donate, donate, donate!","5771":"Great place to visit.","5772":"Although pre booked we still had to queue for around 20 minutes.","5773":"The queue seemed longer than it was due to social distancing.","5774":"We were in and out of the zoo within about 2 and a half hours but had plenty of time to do see everything.","5775":"It was great that unlike some other zoos I\u2019d the animals were in their enclosure you could still see them through windows.","5776":"Due to it being a sunny day we were lucky that most of the animals were out sunbathing.","5777":"Would recommend if you have some spare time.","5778":"An Uber cost is \u00a35 each was in and out of Edinburgh city centre.","5779":"Had a family day out here as it was my daughters 8th birthday.","5780":"We had 4 adults and 4 children with us.","5781":"The good points was my daughter got a birthday card from the zoo, children enjoyed the animals we could see especially the kola bears as there was a baby one (very cute) and the play park and staff were friendly.","5782":"The bad points was having to queue up to get in, ( why have a timed ticket if you still have to queue for 20 minutes or longer?)","5783":"dirty windows on many of the animal cages making it hard to see the animals, lots of enclosures with no animals or you can\u2019t see them, felt some of the enclosures\/cages far too small for some of the bigger animals, some animal enclosures seemed overgrown.","5784":"Having to queue up to see the pandas and kola bears (25 minutes or so)Having said all that the children really enjoyed it and my daughters favourite animal is flamingos.","5785":"But won\u2019t be back for a while as too expensive for the experience.","5786":"We visited zoo on 14\/06, arrived after 10 oclock.","5787":"Parking area was empty at that time so there was no problem of finding an empty spot.","5788":"There were many people in the queue, but it was quick to get in as all tills were opened.","5789":"We got the park map with clearly stated one-way or two way routes.","5790":"I understand why you're charging \u00a322pp, as the animal care costs a fortune and you're dependant on the amount of visitors, but with plenty areas closed and some messy spaces I don't think it's fair price.","5791":"In the area itself we felt comfy and safe, there were arrows on the path and plenty of signs all around.","5792":"Unfortunately there were plenty of people who just don't care at all.","5793":"PROS:","5794":"Easy to find parking spot, quick check-in.","5795":"Stated routes, animals seemed okay and happy.","5796":"The new giraffe house with its surroundings is really nice.","5797":"Chimpanzees had fun so we were amused.","5798":"In general, we enjoyed the walk around.","5799":"CONS:","5800":"We didn't find an opened caf\u00e9 or restaurant, so we were hungry all day and went for a lunch after we left the zoo.","5801":"Some areas were closed.","5802":"And some customers don't stick to the rules, but there's not much you can do with them, as there are plenty of signs everywhere.","5803":"This has to be one of the BEST zoos I have been to!!","5804":"It was HUGE!!!","5805":"We loved seeing pandas, lions and the monkeys.","5806":"The kids had so much fun","5807":"but so did I!Some parts were closed due to covid however still loved the visit!There are lots of steep hills so make sure you\u2019re prepared to walk.","5808":"It was sometimes difficult with a buggy.","5809":"Overall- 10\/10!","5810":"I visited the zoo 2 years ago for a day trip and thought we would try the after hours zoo visit.","5811":"We booked for 6pm on an adults only night, it was a sold out night so there was a large queue although the queue went quite quickly.","5812":"Food -There were several food vans serving all sorts from chips, noodles, doughnuts, hot dogs etc.","5813":"There was also a bar to buy alcoholic drinks and watch live music.","5814":"Layout -The zoo is set on a hill, there is quite a lot of walking but they offer vehicles for those that struggle with mobility.","5815":"Animals -Large variety of animals to see, few areas were closed off but this wasn\u2019t an issue (koala house and female panda house).","5816":"We saw the male panda outside however.","5817":"I think sometimes people forget the animals are entitled to hide away, they don\u2019t have to be on display for peoples\u2019 entertainment.","5818":"All animals we saw looked well and seeing them in evening was a different experience.","5819":"The rhinos and monkeys especially seemed to have extra energy!","5820":"Despite having a timed entry we had to queue for 35 minutes to gain entry.","5821":"There is limited car parking so arrive early if you want a space.","5822":"It took us 30 minutes to find a space.","5823":"The zoo is built on quite a steep hill which is a struggle with a buggy.","5824":"A number of enclosures didn't appear to have anything in them or we couldn't see anything in them.","5825":"A number of areas were closed off, possibily due to Covid, which meant seeing animals from a long way off.","5826":"There were no animal feeding times, again possibly due to Covid.","5827":"The highlights were the pandas and penquins.","5828":"Arrived at 1030am on June 9th for an 11am rhino experience.","5829":"We were  given a warm welcome at reception and were handed a key for a locker to store our bags and shoes while doing the experience.","5830":"We were directed to a hut where we met Sarah, who took us on the rhino experience  .","5831":"The 2 rhinos were asleep inside and wouldn't wake up, despite various attempts by Sarah shaking the food bucket and shouting them !!","5832":"We went inside the Rhino house   and all off a sudden the rhinos woke up and moved .","5833":"What an incredible sight to see 2 rhinos so close .","5834":"They were enormous but very gentle when we fed them.","5835":"The whole experience was amazing.","5836":"Thank you Sarah for making our visit and experience so amazing and memorable.","5837":"Would highly recommend doing an experience at the zoo, it's an amazing feeling being so close to the animals.","5838":"The whole day was amazing and the zoo was covid  safe, despite the zoo being very busy.","5839":"Many ThanksIan And Kathleen Edwards","5840":"Visited zoo on 8thjuly was very disappointed on this occasion it was not value for money half the enclosures were empty the section where you went inside that housed the small mammals were closed due to COVID restrictions walking up a steep hill to get to the attraction and then to fink that\u2019s the enclosure is empty is no fun it looks like the zoo has been neglected  during its closure not improved the admission should be greatly reduced until the zoo is fully functional again","5841":"Visited the Zoo while in Edinburgh and was really impressed - the Covid procedures are pretty good, though the British public continues to be pretty bad at social distancing, and the range of animals on display is great.","5842":"Particularly the koalas and Pandas which are exclusive to Edinburgh were good.","5843":"I did really miss the keeper talks (which are cancelled at the moment due to Covid) but some of the animals have a digital talk which you can access from your phone which was good - I would recommend the zoo do more of these, or perhaps created an audio tour (the videos can drain your data a bit) but would definitely recommend to anyone visiting the area.","5844":"Limited parking we had to park 1\/4 mile awayNot much to see as its overgrown looking a bit tiredWas a bit disappointed for what we had paid for five adultsAnd a waste of a day","5845":"We visited with my two young children who were so excited to visit the zoo but sadly I was a little let down.","5846":"The place is looking run down.","5847":"The new park area was quite good","5848":"but I felt the place lacked any real","5849":"wow factor overall.","5850":"The food is overpriced and the quality is really poor so would definitely recommend taking a picnic with you.","5851":"We barely caught a look at any of the animals as the enclosures were very over grown and the glass was so dirty.","5852":"I understand this isn\u2019t the easiest to maintain but sadly meant viewing the animals was very hard.","5853":"In terms of covid 19 - sanitizer was provided all over the zoo which I was glad to see.","5854":"The one way system to us was very clear and signage remind the public about the rules was all over the place.","5855":"Unfortunately due to the high number of people in the park crowding was unavoidable and I didn\u2019t feel very safe.","5856":"I didn\u2019t see much social distancing which is the responsibility of the individuals, however I would urge the zoo to look at this as we visited on a Monday during the school term","5857":"so I hate to imagine what it would be like at the weekend.","5858":"Overall an average family day out.","5859":"Wouldn\u2019t rush back.","5860":"After my last visit a few years back I swore I would never come back to Edinburgh zoo however we were staying in the area and my kids love animals so I decided to give it another chance.","5861":"I booked a 1.00pm slot, we arrived for 12.30 and the line was at the top of the car park.","5862":"People we\u2019re sensible and kept their distance and the line went done quick enough.","5863":"We got in bang on 1 o\u2019clock.","5864":"Although it was busy again people took their time and waited for their turn to see the animals.","5865":"I must say the zoo has dramatically improved we saw lots of fantastic animals.","5866":"A naughty chimp working it ticket with the older chimps was the highlight for my 2 children.","5867":"The pandas although asleep were  amazing and all the other animals to.","5868":"All in all we had a lovely time and this time il be happy to return.","5869":"Great zoo with loads of things to see.","5870":"Pandas and Koalas stole the show, but sadly both asleep when we visited.","5871":"Feel both animals are still milking their cuteness.","5872":"Perhaps the zoo could instigate bear battles....","5873":"The sun bears vs the koalas would be a good match.","5874":"Good choice of food.","5875":"The long entrance queue went down really quickly.","5876":"Very hilly, although plenty of places to stop for a break.","5877":"Only downside was a rather expensive toy we bought in he shop.","5878":"Didn't even last until we got back to the hotel before the stuffing started to come out.","5879":"Would highly recommend a day out with the family to the zoo!!","5880":"Our slot was 1030 but get there very early as you have to que but we spent 5hrs there & would of been longer if not for tired children.","5881":"One way system is in place but not really followed & quite a lot of people for the area we thought.","5882":"Eating places are restricted but we got into the restaurant no bother & was as good as before.","5883":"Toilets are there but not cleaned regular.","5884":"Didn\u2019t see as many animals as would of like but that could of been down to the warm sun & a lot is sectioned off which is a shame as makes it harder for getting near to see & the place looks a little run down.","5885":"Enjoyable day out though with happy kids & that\u2019s the main thing.","5886":"I\u2019ve desperately wanted to visit the pandas for tears and finally got to do it.","5887":"I loved seeing them.","5888":"We headed up there straight away and saw Tian Tian in the enclosure munching on bamboo.","5889":"No sign of the other one.","5890":"We managed to get some photos but wasn\u2019t easy with the glare from the glass and we said we would try again later.","5891":"We were lucky to see tian tian outside on the next trek up the hill and discovered where The other panda was which wasn\u2019t open earlier which is why we didn\u2019t see her.","5892":"There are some lovely areas, the penguin area is lovely especially seeing all the young ones being looked after.","5893":"The wallabies and kangaroos were lovely and we enjoyed their area.","5894":"However none of the hand sanitiser\u2019s worked on the way in or out.","5895":"Not everyone stuck to the one way\/stay to right system in place.","5896":"Some people were selfish hogging the window viewing of the pandas(just lack of manners)The parking was fine and our slot was 10:30 and there were lots of spaces.","5897":"I hadn\u2019t read anything prior to going that said how steep the zoo was-blimey it\u2019s a workout getting to the pandas.","5898":"Lol.","5899":"The view from the top was good though.","5900":"Just wish they would lop the tops off some trees.","5901":"Spent around 3hours at the zoo and felt we saw all that we wanted to.","5902":"An outstanding visitor attraction that comfortably reigns as the jewel in Edinburgh's tourism crown.","5903":"The giant pandas alone make it a must-see destination but the whole experience from the friendly and helpful staff right through to the facilities in general makes it difficult to choose which superlative is best suited to describe this wonderful day out.","5904":"I visited here as a boy and I loved it.","5905":"However, I can't say the same for it now.","5906":"My son and I visited yesterday and we did enjoy it a little but we found it was a bit overcrowded.","5907":"We wanted to see the Koalas feeding but the queue was massive.","5908":"We went to look at the tigers but couldn't see them.","5909":"We then looked for the Lions.","5910":"We found them resting high up on some wooden planks but they were hard to see.","5911":"The penguins were entertaining though and we did enjoy looking at the Wallaby's too.","5912":"In general though, there were either too many people blocking the view, or the animals simply weren't there.","5913":"Loads of crying spoilt children and families blocking the way.","5914":"It was a harsh reminder that a zoo isn't all sunshine and rainbows too.","5915":"A family pointed out how cute it was to watch a Chimp nurture her baby, when all I could see was a sad animal that could see no happy future for it's child being cooped up in an enclosure no bigger than my house.","5916":"On top of this, the Zoo doesn't appear to be well kept either.","5917":"Covid may be to blame for this","5918":"but I'd thought they'd make it look a bit more presentable before re opening the doors.","5919":"Overgrown grass and weeds are everywhere, it just doesn't look good.","5920":"I'm not saying don't go, simply don't expect too much...","5921":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo as a family of four, we had a brilliant time.","5922":"The kids loved seeing all the animals especially the penguins.","5923":"The staff were lovely and made us feel welcome.","5924":"We had lunch and it was tasty and not the usual overpriced food you lend to get at attractions.","5925":"We can't wait to go back to see the Giraffes","5926":"Absolutely terrible.","5927":"Most of the animals were not visible.","5928":"The food was either sold out or what was available was either a terrible selection or terrible quality.","5929":"Basically paying \u00a360 to walk around an over grown park.","5930":"Covid has made the experience even worse with parts of the zoo closed and a confusing one way system and full of ignorant people.","5931":"Absolutely terrible.","5932":"Fantastic to get to visit the Zoo after Lockdown for a well anticipated family day out and to provide as much support for the Animals.","5933":"Easy online ticket purchases, fast-flowing and well managed queues on entry and friendly staff.","5934":"And, unfortunately; that\u2019s where the positive side ends.","5935":"It is completely understandable that the Zoo would not be operating as it was pre-pandemic, but gosh; it\u2019s gone downhill fast - and it must have been quite poor before the pandemic too.","5936":"It\u2019s just all a bit tatty,  with a few sparse animals here and there - no real impact at all.","5937":"Huge areas of vacant spaces where there used to be animals, now just over-grown unkempt spaces.. a lot of the animal enclosures (that have animal in them) are so overgrown\/a mess that you can\u2019t really make out what the animal is.","5938":"We chatted with so many people saying the same thing.","5939":"Great to see some new parts being developed, the Giraffe enclosure is encouraging... but who designed the new kids play-park?","5940":"It looks like something a local council would put in a residential block with spare change.","5941":"Imagination?","5942":"Integration into the wildlife\/conservation theme?","5943":"What happened there?","5944":"You\u2019ve given someone access to the Argos account and they\u2019ve orders straight from the back-pages.","5945":"We visited on a sold-out, very busy day and almost non-existent facilities : by 11am all the sandwiches had sold out (from the two huts selling them) after queuing for 30 minutes and alternatives were crisps, rocky Road Cakes etc.","5946":"Why are the facilities all closed?","5947":"Surely it can\u2019t be social distancing?","5948":"You were allowing queues from the two open huts with hundreds of people - opening others around the park would have been safer\/more commercial (the zoo needs the money clearly) and much more enjoyable for everyone.","5949":"We love what Edinburgh Zoo used to be - a real benchmark for Zoo\u2019s.","5950":"We started our RZSS journey as members then life members and finally became patrons a few years ago.","5951":"Whilst we have always loved our visits to Edinburgh Zoo & Highland Wildlife Park, and been immensely proud of the national & global conservation contributions of RZSS, the Zoo in particular was showing some signs of age.","5952":"Enter David Field, the new CEO with big plans and an obvious love for and drive to improve both parks.","5953":"Changes can already be seen around the Zoo - with tired areas being spruced up and uninspiring enclosures undergoing repurposing.","5954":"Even tired looking loos have been given magnificent murals.","5955":"The years ahead will be incredibly exciting!The new Giraffe enclosure is stunning with a great team in charge (and the boys are gorgeous!)","5956":"Won\u2019t spoil it for those yet to see the area but the building, art and the many viewing areas cannot fail to impress.","5957":"Visit, become a member or dive in and become a Patron - you won\u2019t be disappointed and you\u2019ll be helping this magnificent charity with every penny.","5958":"A very well organised zoo, following covid restrictions and advise and was fantastic to see people following the instructions with no challenges.","5959":"Lots of wonderful animals, obviously the Giant pandas that we went to see were the highlight, closely followed by red panda, rhino and pengiuns.","5960":"No complaints as a family, we at at the restaurant, cheesy chips and nachos, lovely food, clean, safe and well organised.","5961":"Some animal exhibits still closed, but can see that the zoo are doing everything to get these open safely.","5962":"But enough animals to spend a considerable amount of time there, we were looking round for 6 hours.","5963":"Very hilly, we are all tired, but we did earn a Saturday night takeaway, so all tired but very happy.","5964":"Thank You, edinburgh zoo for a wonderful day.","5965":"Have to pre book due to COVID.","5966":"10am entrance and there was a long que.","5967":"however it moved really quickly.","5968":"It\u2019s quite a hilly zoo so thing twice if your coming with a heavy buggy or with a wheelchair user - you might not be able to see everything.","5969":"To check outGiant pandas are great (although apparently these are on Lon from China for 1mil a year and it\u2019s about to expire)Rhinos are great - massiveThere was a cute little baby hippoOtters were super cute - and we got to see them being fed and running away from the crowd trying to steal their food.","5970":"As soon as you enter you see meerkats which are very cute.","5971":"Pelican walk through is great - they are massive.","5972":"The sun bear is a lot smaller than expected - but great to see.","5973":"Penguin area was really good.","5974":"Squirrel Monkeys were super cute and came right up to the looking windows.","5975":"Sadly the other animals weren\u2019t so active or it was difficult to loacate them and there were a few things closed.","5976":"It looks like a lovely zoo but loads of things were closed with notices about covid on them.","5977":"It\u2019s \u00a322 for an adult ticket.","5978":"Limas, closed, wallabies closed, giraffes closed, it just went on and on.","5979":"I saw a tiger, lots of penguins, a panda, 4 ravens, a seagull, 2 magpies and a blackbird!","5980":"Seriously, stay closed till there are actually animals available to see, or don\u2019t charge \u00a322 a ticket!","5981":"We had to cancel our Christmas lights trip here & the zoo were very helpful at organising a gift voucher which we used recently.","5982":"Staff were very welcoming & friendly & were dotted throughout the park at Koala\u2019s and pandas to answer any questions.","5983":"Our 3 year old loved it","5984":"and we can\u2019t wait to come back.","5985":"We are member off the zooAmazing looking so good, fresh new art workLoads of new exciting changing happening insideStaff always to friendly and know there stuff when u stop them and ask a question they alway answer and happy to talk you and all about the animalsFrom the man at otterYoung lady at tigersAnd another young lady at koalasEvery time we go we see and find out diffrent information my 4 kids ages 12-7 love itEven just a couple hr in a Sunday after noon","5986":"We visited here this weekend.","5987":"They have a good COVID safe system in place and you feel safe all the time (apart from the odd rude or ignorant person not following the guidelines but they exist everywhere).","5988":"They really have kept the place looking very sharp in spite of a tough year (I expect).","5989":"The giraffes will be an exciting addition.","5990":"There\u2019s a great range of animals to see in an exciting range of ways!","5991":"The staff seem happy and really keen to talk and share their knowledge (of which there is plenty to go about).I\u2019d say this is the perfect family day out as we ease out of lockdown!","5992":"We had a good day and our kids had a ball but.........","5993":"The zoo is looking great very tired in places.","5994":"The last time we were there thre dinosaurs were on display at the top off the hill.","5995":"That are has now fallen into disrepair.","5996":"Other areas are also looking very tired.","5997":"Now for the covid restrictions and it should be noted that you are still paying full price.","5998":"There is no talks from the zoo keepers, many areas closed off and only one cafe open.","5999":"Toilets are one family at a time so expect to que although there is portaloos I don't consider these appropriate for families nor hygienic during restrictions.","6000":"Make sure you bring a picnic  as nothing is open and the only place to get hot food impossible to take a table.","6001":"The area for the the giraffes looks impressive but the rest of the zoo is needing similar investment.","6002":"Very disappointed to be writing this as we love zoos and appreciate how much they have suffered due to lockdown.","6003":"However, we left feeling totally ripped off.","6004":"There are some restrictions in place (many understandable - some less so) and feel that it wasn't really reasonable to be charging an already expensive full price ticket in light of the restrictions.","6005":"I am no expert but some of the restrictions such as closure of some outdors walkways and cancellation of ALL keeper talks incl outdoor makes very little sense to a layman such as myself, particularly when masks can be worn - and you can walk around indoor museums, shops etc currently.","6006":"Additionally on a couple of instances, the closure of viewing space for the animals lead to instances of grouping at the lessened viewing points, so it seemed a bit self-defeating on occasion.","6007":"The infantilising signs all over the place, such as 'don't touch things you don't need to' (or words to that effect) just rubbed salt into the wounds.","6008":"Quality of food in the restaurant Vs price too.","6009":"Absolutely gutted to be honest.","6010":"No issue with restrictions where needed but outdoor seems a bit far in the context of other things that are allowed - especially with mitigations.","6011":"Maybe there are valid reasons but in a world where (eg) golf courses have been forced to close in the near past - who knows.","6012":"Highly rate the zoo.","6013":"I am not usually a fan but this one is spacious has has some lovely places for the animals.","6014":"We brought our 11 month year old boy and he enjoyed the day a lot!","6015":"We visited during the Covid restrictions but they adapted really well to them.","6016":"It wasn\u2019t overcrowded and spaced out nicely.","6017":"Some zoos have massive empty spaces with no animals.","6018":"But this zoo seemed to make good use of its empty space.","6019":"It was a nice feel (especially with the sun shining).","6020":"All of the animals seemed really alert and awake, wandering around.","6021":"The pandas were great!","6022":"So we\u2019re the lions.","6023":"Something for everyone.","6024":"Perhaps will be a bit tough for those with mobility issues due to the hills etc-","6025":"but deffo worthy of a full 5 stars!","6026":"Due to restrictions the indoor activities\/ attractions were not available due to restrictions but we had a great family day out.","6027":"I love coming back to Edinburgh Zoo every now and then and spend the whole day there.","6028":"Sometimes we take some food and have a small picnic but this time the weather was not great for that.","6029":"The only downside was that the tickets had to be purchased online in advance and they had limited numbers of visitors permitted.","6030":"Totally not worth the \u00a363 entrance fee!","6031":"Alot of things are closed and the windows in the viewing areas are filthy.","6032":"Take my advice, spend your money on something else.","6033":"Also the disabled parking is not clearly marked and there is nobody in the car park to help you.","6034":"My wife, youngest daughter and her friend went to the zoo for the first time in years.","6035":"It was not long after restrictions had lifted and while there were some animals that weren\u2019t on display there was still plenty to keep us entertained.","6036":"It wasn\u2019t as bust as you\u2019d expect which is understandable with what\u2019s going on.","6037":"You can walk about without a face mask as your outside.","6038":"We saw the likes of monkeys, zebras and the pandas.","6039":"The food kiosk are well manned it a little expensive.","6040":"But we had a good time!","6041":"I always love a visit to the zoo.","6042":"I grew up next door (often woken by the seals being fed which are sadly no longer there, and hearing all the animals getting excited about breakfast!)I visited every year with school and now take my children there when I can.","6043":"It's always a good experience.","6044":"I laughed at one of the reviews saying it was too hilly.","6045":"I think you can gauge that before you enter the zoo that its on a hill, it's going to be hilly","6046":"but I belive for those with mobillity issues you can request assistance to the top of the hill?","6047":"I might be wrong but Im sure I heard this.","6048":"I love it - when you get to the top picnic area (just above the Panda and Zebra enclosure)","6049":"the view is stunning.","6050":"Ideal lunch spot wtih clean toilets, hand washing station and a park for the kids.","6051":"Since lockdown the zoo, on our visits there has been good signage and reminders to keep distant etc.","6052":"There are hand sanitising units dotted about which is good and every-time we've been, visitors have been sensible.","6053":"The zoo was clean and friendly staff walking about offering directions and info about some animals.","6054":"Edinburgh zoo is a great day out - just dont expect to see every single animal right in front of you, sometimes you have to come back later in the day.","6055":"Its not pay and demand.","6056":"I love supporting the zoo with our visits - I know how much every ticket purchased is appreciated by the staff to keep these wonderful animals safe and healthy.","6057":"Also cant wait to see giraffes back at the zoo - the enclosure is looking fantastic!","6058":"As Scotland emerges from lockdown, our first foray from Glasgow was to Edinburgh Zoo!","6059":"Animals were visible and enjoying the sunshine.","6060":"We were especially pleased that although keeper talks are paused, we encountered Animal Presenter James at the cassowaries and later at the penguins.","6061":"He knows the residents as individuals, and explained: \"The female cassowary is Sydney and the male is Billy.","6062":"Usually they're kept apart as they're solitary in the wild but we're hoping for chicks this year!\"","6063":"We're looking forward to a return visit when indoor spaces re-open to the public.","6064":"We had a most enjoyable day at the zoo!","6065":"Certainly a different experience to what it normally is, and a lot is closed off.","6066":"I understand the full price tickets would frustrate ..","6067":"but we booked anyway, aware of this.","6068":"We actually booked initially for a rainy day but they permit one date change which is brill, and we went today, in the sun!","6069":"(Shout out to helpful Nikki for the quick change of date!!)Overall we saw a lot, and the children enjoyed the animals, plus the play areas.","6070":"We took a picnic and had this up in the hill top area.","6071":"It was lovely!We finished off with tubs of ice cream by the penguins.","6072":"A great day was had and we were happy to pay full price to continue to fund our amazing zoo and animals in difficult times.","6073":"Topjob by the zoo staff!","6074":"Had a really lovely time today at the zoo, me and my friend spoke to James, Nigora and Maurice (we think that's how to spell their names!)","6075":"at different points around the zoo and they were all so lovely and helpful!","6076":"We were really lucky to see most of the animals and had a really nice trip out.","6077":"Shame you can't go inside to see the indoor enclosures as they are wonderful too, but it was wonderful to be able to go and support the zoo and see the animals in the sunshine!!","6078":"Not worth the money.","6079":"Of course, all indoor exhibit areas were closed due to COVID.","6080":"But few animals viable outdoors.","6081":"Our grandchildren were quite disappointed.","6082":"Their memory of the zoo will be the play parks","6083":"I so wish I could write a different review,I went with my very young granddaughter and her grandmother, we were so looking forward to this, we were alarmed at the outlay for this event  \u00a321.95 per adult is quite expensive, but considering we hadn\u2019t been in a long time we thought, why not, it would be a great day out, the weather was good, and considering the horrible time we ALL have been having due to Covid19 we were excited, the reception hall is a good standard and staff were welcoming and informative.","6084":"I have visited other zoos in various locations and countries, I have been to Edinburgh Zoo often in the past, albeit a good while ago, it became very quickly obvious that there are many enclosures which had at best the appearance of being unoccupied at worst they just were, many enclosures are extremely run down looking, in fact almost everything has a run down and dirty appearance, there was no care about the glass where it was installed, as to the ability to see through it, not only was most glass filthy, but the fact that during this pandemic \u2018NO ONE\u2019 was considering or taking care of any virus that could be being left on the glass that \u2018EVERYONE\u2019 is obliged to touch to shield the light reflection, if there was any wish to see what may or not be behind the glass, poor show, mostly the best kept areas are the children\u2019s parks, the only exception being the Wallaby enclosure where you can get to walk through the enclosure, the animals look happy there and there are a few areas that you don\u2019t get to wander through but the animals look \u2018more natural\u2019, it\u2019s not great seeing majestic animals caged and pacing showing signs of neurosis, I do appreciate the good that zoo\u2019s do in regards to conservation etc, so there is a bit of need to see the benefits as being more important, it is sad though, still there is really no need to have the zoo so looking like a worksite where there is still a lot to do, today reminded me of being at the docks or a run down holiday resort, whichever place that gives that feeling, we should not have left there today feeling that way","6085":"and yes we both grandmother","6086":"and I felt the same way, we wanted to have a wonderful day, not only because of the \u00a344 admission which is a fortune when you have several children, but being around the animals, someone in charge should take an objective look at the whole zoo, beyond the fancy entrance and see what visitors are seeing, Edinburgh Zoo should not be an embarrassment, and frankly as we saw it today it is, the animals should be shown off in a proper manner and not in this rundown scruffy dirty manner, I love animals and have always been around them, I come from the countryside, I was brought up around horses and farm animals, so I\u2019m not expecting something unreasonable, the heads of Edinburgh Zoo should possibly go and visit other well maintained Zoos around the World, unfortunately Edinburgh didn\u2019t look like one for us today","6087":"\ud83e\udd72","6088":"Attention !!!!","6089":"DO NOT PURCHASE A MEMBERSHIP YOU WILL BE CHEATED.","6090":"If you purchase a membership you will not be able to visit during the weekends and outside school times (although the terms and conditions do not state this, it is true)!","6091":"As you have to book a slot before your visit only morning and early afternoon slots are given to members and only during the week days.","6092":"However, if you\u2019re not a member you can purchase pay as you go tickets for the weekend and all times easily (many free spaces are available).","6093":"Lovely collection, be ready to use some leg muscle for checking out the top end off the zoo","6094":"it\u2019s pretty high but work the visit","6095":"Had a great day out visiting Edinburgh zoo.","6096":"Loved seeing all the animals especially the penguins.","6097":"Highly recommend for a great day out, can\u2019t wait to take my son!","6098":"It is great to have the chance to walk in the sunshine and talk to the Zoo staff about the animals.","6099":"Today a keeper pointed out a 'new to us' animal - a Luzon cloud rat that she was feeding.","6100":"This kind of engagement is an added bonus for a regular visitor.","6101":"As members during the pandemic we can enter the zoo from 2pm without booking in advance.","6102":"Although the normal zoo offering is reduced being a member is great value for money and worth considering if you live locally.","6103":"Went to the zoo yesterday and was quiet disappointed that there wasn\u2019t a penguin parade and even the feeding was disappointing.","6104":"Many animals not there like the giraffes \ud83d\ude29.","6105":"The pandas were hiding unfortunately.","6106":"Only 1 small cafe open .","6107":"At \u00a320 each it\u2019s quiet expensive 40 for a couple but hopefully the money helps feed the animals during these tough times.","6108":"I do think they should warn visitors though as the penguin parade is a must.","6109":"Very quiet so easy to avoid others.","6110":"We visited the zoo on a week day since my husband and I didn't want to travel far and wanted it to be quiet to avoid any crowds since we're both vulnerable to covid.","6111":"We thought entry price was a little steep, but since it was a charity they must be struggling so we were happy to pay the full amount.","6112":"And like most places you can book in advance too!We took our time and went around twice, but the zoo is on a steep hill and it can be tiring walking up.","6113":"You have been warned!!We managed to see most of the animals, some of our favourites being the big cats!!","6114":"And the panda.","6115":"And the staff were so helpful!","6116":"From the nice girl at the front who took our tickets and explained all the rules about the one way system to the staff stationed at different interesting animals.","6117":"We kept bumping into (not literally of course lol) the same members of staff!","6118":"We met the same girl, Kirsty was her name, at tigers and koalas who was fantastic at pointing the little cutie koloas out, talked all about the new tiger and lions, and the plan for giraffes next year!My husband thought the price of food and drink was little expensive, but I was happy with a coffee and watching the penguins.","6119":"All in all a great day out!","6120":"Id probably revisit, but in spring or summer since I heard you're getting some new giraffes next year!","6121":"Love how this zoo really melts into the hillside and surrounding greenery.","6122":"Excellently landscaped.","6123":"I did wonder to what extent they took covid seriously, though, as many of the kid\u2019s interactive games and exhibits looked very grubby.","6124":"But an excellent zoo","6125":"After seeing the zoo on Inside the Zoo and the amazing work they do I wanted to visit and popped along on a misty Monday.","6126":"There wasn't too many people and this allowed time to just stand and peacefully watch the animals.","6127":"There is good one way signage and clear markings to keep apart from other visitors, and stay safe during covid times.","6128":"Unfortunately there was no sign of the giant pandas, however I've seen them on previous visits.","6129":"This actually makes me happy not to see them as it means they have access to a private area away from visitors.","6130":"Got to see the lions which was great, and the penguins were as always graceful and lovely to watch.","6131":"A great zoo that cares about the animals and conservation.","6132":"A great day out and easily accessible from the city centre.","6133":"The animals are provided with large enclosures and lots of places to hide should they need some privacy.","6134":"The keepers and staff are knowledgeable and helpful and always happy to answer any questions you have.","6135":"The tapirs, rhinos and hippos were my favourites.","6136":"The conservation work done by the zoo is amazing too!","6137":"If I could review this less that 1 I would.","6138":"The asiatuc lion area wasnnot open, the penguin enclosure had plastic penguins in, there were no:SOUTHERN PEDUBANTENGOR ANYTHING ELSEOr any other animals available to see.","6139":"Oh Yes there was one panda and a few flamingos.","6140":"I paid \u00a321.95 for this and no warning that this would be the case.","6141":"I was on a weekend break as training for work locally on the Friday and was going to recommend it to colleagues.","6142":"I've been ripped off and this whole experience  has left me feeling incredibly upset and disgusted that everyone in there will have had the same experience.","6143":"NEVER EVER GO HERE -","6144":"THE OWNERS SOULD BE ASHAMED OF THEMSELVES","6145":"First of all I'll make it clear I'm not a fan of Zoos in general, particularly those outdated cramped enclosures in older Zoos.","6146":"We visited in early August and a week before were just able to get two tickets to the late opening.","6147":"We arrived about 30 minutes before our ticket time and the queue was massive, with the car park full to bursting, saying that we were still able to get in not much after our ticket time.","6148":"A one way system was in place and was adhered to by most people, but it did mean overcrowding as you entered and created some bottlenecks.","6149":"The main purpose of our visit like most was to see the Giant Pandas, as outside of a trip to China which isn't likely for a long time there is no closer way to see them and despite the female just sleeping and the male just eating (no change there then) it still felt special to see them in person.","6150":"The rest of the Zoo had the usual attractions with particular highlights being the monkeys, red pandas and lions.","6151":"Despite being a late opening a number of enclosures weren't accessible and many closed well before closing time which was disappointing.","6152":"The adult ticket cost \u00a317.50 with childs \u00a39.50 (opening time 17.30-20.30)","6153":"it was worth it just to see the pandas.","6154":"Cant recommend enough.","6155":"The Koalas are a must see and the giant pandas.","6156":"Penguin rock fab too.","6157":"Up hill so need comfy shoes","6158":"We took our 5 year old grandson for a day out and he thoroughly enjoyed it, although many walk through attractions were closed due to Covid 19, it was still a wonderful experience for him and us.","6159":"My only complaint is that the Penguin cafe was a complete rip off!!!","6160":"We were charged \u00a323.95 for a kids meal, 2 coffees, 2 cold sandwiches and a bag of crisps!!!","6161":"Come on people ???","6162":"One egg and cress sandwich was \u00a35.00???","6163":"They don\u2019t even charge that in the airport???","6164":"It breaks my heart to say it but this Zoo has had its day!!If you are lucky enough to see any animals then you will see that they don't look happy.","6165":"The viewing point at the top is a waste of time also....the trees now hide the view.i would say do not waste your time or money going here until severe upgrades have been made.","6166":"Have been to a few zoos before, and this one is definitely in my top 3.","6167":"Spent there about 6 hours to ensure we didn't miss any animal, but I must say about 45 minutes of that was us looking at pandas eating bamboo leaves.","6168":"It truly is extraordinary to see actual pandas!","6169":"Lions, otters, and sun bears gave us a little show too, so it was a really great day.","6170":"We visit Edinburgh Zoo as much as we can It's not as big as other zoos and on a hill so it's a bit of a climb to see some of the animals Our favourites are the Red Pandas Ginger Bruce and little Riarudh The pride of lions and Dharma the tiger are amazing There is nothing we can say that is negative about the place On asking one volunteer about a concern we had she said she would find out for us and went out of her way to find us to put our minds at rest As for comments being made about social distancing  the only issue we had was from parents not keeping their children under control otherwise it was fine These beautiful animals are not there for our entertainment","6171":"so if they don't want to appear it's up to them Also comments about a waste of money are ludicrous because by paying the entrance fee you are helping the animals at the zoo but also helping them all over the world Thankyou to everyone at the zoo and amazing animals for making us smile in these awful times xxxx","6172":"Me and my partner visited this pub in September on a lucky hot day, the staff were eager to help and even the food exceeded expectations!","6173":"The penguin enclosure was by far our favourite.","6174":"Visited the zoo yesterday hardly any animals to see and a lot of the zoo blocked off for the cost for a family shocking they should at least reduce the price until open fullyMy advice don\u2019t waste you\u2019re money until open fully","6175":"Arrived at 10am - queue moved quickly and the families around us were distanced.","6176":"Not sure how the previous review was so different, maybe unlucky they encountered people that didn\u2019t understand distancing?!The zoo itself is good, and the staff we came across were friendly.","6177":"The grounds are well kept but there felt like a lack of interesting animals but maybe that\u2019s just us.","6178":"The only down point is the food on offer for visitors.","6179":"The zoo should be ashamed to charge the prices for what they sell.","6180":"The bacon roll (was it microwaved?) and tuna and cheese panini that was lukewarm and lacking in filling was a joke.","6181":"This was from the penguin cafe.","6182":"Would definitely take a packed lunch next time.","6183":"All in all a nice day out.","6184":"This is our first post lockdown zoo trip and may be our last until the pandemic is over.","6185":"We had 10am booked and the car park and queues were truly shocking.","6186":"Terrible distancing!!","6187":"I had thought entry was staggered to avoid this very issue but its a covid\/track and trace disaster!","6188":"Certainly there were least 200+ in a dense queue.","6189":"Also be warned a lot of the zoo is closed off and its still full price.....","6190":"We used to be members too for many years but dont think theyre really got the whole entry bit down..","6191":"We booked a trip to the Zoo as a previous trip had to be cancelled due to COVID.","6192":"We had our two grand kids with us and they loved seeing some of their favourite animals close up and therefore had a brilliant time.","6193":"My only disappointment was some of the COVID measures meant we didn't get the full experience, and some of the queueing wasn't controlled too well","6194":"The zoo handled the social distancing rules very well.","6195":"One way systems meant that we got to see all of the animals and didn't feel rushed at all!","6196":"Of all the zoos in the UK, this one offers some of the best up close experiences with a great variety of animals!","6197":"One of the best zoo\u2019s iv been to with a wide range of different animals to see.","6198":"Also great system in place for going round the zoo due to covid 19 as well and a lot of hand gel stations","6199":"Edinburgh zoo is in my opinion the best zoo that I have seen in the way of animal welfare, staff friendliness, information and hygiene.","6200":"The enclosures were large and very enriching which left me and my partner in awe.","6201":"The zoo is running a one way system which means that there are less people to run in to.","6202":"The staff were all very knowledgeable and it is very clear that they feel passionate about the animals that they have to look after.","6203":"If we lived closer we would be vistors much much more often.","6204":"With a mixture of biome walk through enclosures and mixed specie exhibits the zoo really had everything.","6205":"Will 100% be returning after covid!","6206":"Had a great visit, everything very well organised and Covid precautions in place.","6207":"Animals clearly well looked after.","6208":"Hopefully they open up some more of the areas sealed off like the viewing platform for the zebras and start the penguin parade again.","6209":"Why the zoo wasn\u2019t allowed to open sooner I do not know!","6210":"We were in Edinburgh last week and had got pre-booked tickets.","6211":"The zoo has changed so mutch over the years.","6212":"It was great to finally see the pandas and the kola bears.","6213":"The facilities are excellent as well.","6214":"Plenty of we cafes for a drink or a bite to eat.","6215":"There is an mini bus for people with mobility problems that takes you up to the top of the zoo .","6216":"The keepers are all very friendly.","6217":"The kids we saw seemed to be enjoying seeing all the animals.","6218":"My favourites are the Mercats .","6219":"I highly recommend this zoo if your staying in Edinburgh.","6220":"The zoo park was worth a visit although the enclosures are so overgrown that it was difficult to spot most of the animals.","6221":"The concession stand prices are utterly outrageous.","6222":"\u00a312,","6223":"yes \u00a312 for a hot dog, chips and a bottle of cheap water.","6224":"Worth \u00a35 at absolute best.","6225":"\u00a311 for 2 coffee\u2019s and 4 doughnuts.","6226":"The doughnuts were average but certainly nothing special.","6227":"This rip off has put me off visiting the zoo again to be honest.","6228":"What a fantastic day out!","6229":"So many incredible things to see, with the chimpanzee house easily one of the best zoo experiences either of us have had at any zoo!","6230":"This was capped off by friendly and knowledgeable staff who were always on hand to inform and educate, making the experience all the more interesting","6231":"Unfortunately lots of the enclosures were empty, it felt more like a walk up a very steep hill than a zoo visit.","6232":"Covid restrictions were easy to follow and staff were helpful but it just felt like we didn't see much for the hefty \u00a320 a person ticket.","6233":"Apart from the busy penguin section, it was very empty.","6234":"Disappointing.","6235":"No queue to get in and hardly anyone there but that was probably due to going on a rainy school day.","6236":"Covid restrictions seem pretty clear and lots of sanitiser around.","6237":"Main positives were seeing the pandas, rhinos and big cats as well as the little cafe we stopped in by the penguins had tasty food and fast service.","6238":"Unfortunately an awful lot of the zoo seems to be closed off without any explanation, warning or reduction in ticket cost to reflect this.","6239":"A member of staff that we unfortunately didn\u2019t grab the name of deserves a huge shout out and really brightened up the visit right towards the end of our time there, a lady working in the chimpanzee building came over to us and started telling us more about them and answered loads of questions we had and explained who each of them are and more about their personalities.","6240":"She was incredibly informative and showed such a genuine passion and care for the animals which was lovely.","6241":"I would also give a word of warning to anyone that might struggle with a lot of up hill walking as it\u2019s built on a slope, it\u2019s not a mountain or anything","6242":"but if I\u2019d been pushing a push chair or wheel chair it could have been tough.","6243":"Overall I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s an absolute must see but it was really great seeing the pandas, big cats and rhinos and it\u2019s a nice half day out with lots of cafes dotted around, nice viewpoints and fun facts\/ interactive bits for kids.","6244":"Again a great visit to the zoo as always.","6245":"The one way system works really well","6246":"and you get to see all the animals.","6247":"Social distancing is in place , helpful staff and volunteers who are there to help you find your way and remind you of social distancing.","6248":"Visited the zoo as part of my birthday trip to Edinburgh.","6249":"Bad weather was forecast all day but we still went as the tickets were pre-booked and not changeable.","6250":"First things first, the staff are lovely and helpful.","6251":"Even though a lot of things are closed due to COVID, there\u2019s some great facilities available.","6252":"The Grassland restaurant has a decent offering and the toilets are all clean.","6253":"Check the website for things that are open before you visit as not all the restaurants are.","6254":"COVID guidelines are being well maintained, with staff around reminding people of the one way routes and when to wear masks.","6255":"The animal collection is great too, with a lot of variety.","6256":"It\u2019s the only place you can see giant pandas in the UK and one of a few where you\u2019ll see koalas.","6257":"The quality of the exhibits is very good, although more sheltered areas would have been appreciated.","6258":"The zoo is all up hill and at times it\u2019s very steep.","6259":"I can\u2019t see the zoo working well for those in wheelchairs unfortunately.","6260":"There could have been more benches around at the top of steeper hills for those less mobile to rest on.","6261":"Due to the rain and COVID closing off a lot of the indoor sections, many animals were off display.","6262":"This is no fault of the zoo though, just something to keep in mind so you\u2019re not disappointed.","6263":"I will add that there\u2019s a lot more animal houses that are actually open than I expected.","6264":"Other zoos I\u2019ve been to have had all their indoor sections closed due to COVID but most of the ones here were open!Overall, I enjoyed my visit but it\u2019s just a shame the circumstances meant I didn\u2019t get to see as much as I could have.","6265":"If the zoo is interested in suggestions, I\u2019d add more benches and more sheltered viewing.","6266":"Fantastic day out, even with safety restrictions in place(which made me feel safe without being an inconvenience) it was excellent value for money.","6267":"Staff were friendly and helpful, animals were easy to view, 3 great play parks inside, food facilities, plenty of well kept toilets and a reasonably priced gift shop.","6268":"Little boy loved the monkeys, tiger, and pandas but the highlight has to be the penguins for me.","6269":"Spent nearly 6 hrs there and could have stayed longer.","6270":"Highly recommend for kids and adults.","6271":"Absolutely brilliant day out!","6272":"Perfect way to spend my birthday, cannot wait to come back again in the future!I believe the covid measures in place such as the one way system actually made the experience more enjoyable as we were able to see all the animals properly and enjoy the whole experience!","6273":"Edinburgh Zoo has a great selection of animals, it\u2019s just a shame that at the moment a large number of them are closed \u2018for our own safety\u2019 according to the numerous signed around the zoo.","6274":"There is supposedly a one was system in the zoo to help with social distancing but is really not very clearly marked out at all and often find yourself being turned around by a member of staff, particularly annoying as there was hardly anyone there on the day that I went.","6275":"Food and drink is very expensive - \u00a312 for a hot small hot chocolate, small coffee and 4 small cold donuts.","6276":"Verdict- if you can, wait until the Covid fiasco is over before visiting to experience all of the zoo at its best.","6277":"If I had know it was going to be as it currently is, I would would have waited.","6278":"Only the panda and cats worth visiting social distancing hard to follow nothing else much to visit food not that good would have been better to take our own the sister zoo of Edinburgh the highland wild life park much better value for money and more to see","6279":"Loved my visit to Edinburgh Zoo.","6280":"I was very lucky to be able to see the Koalas (awake as well) and both pandas on my visit.","6281":"One panda was inside and one outside.","6282":"I queued to see the Koalas twice and was the highlight on my trip to Edinburgh.","6283":"Yes there are at of steep hills","6284":"but it was all worth it","6285":"Loved seeing the all the animals..but there accessibility for disabled people is shocking.","6286":"I understand the zoo is on a hill which can\u2019t be helped but it feels they use this as an excuse not to have any proper accessibility.","6287":"As soon as you go in wheelchairs are told to go to the right to avoid stairs..","6288":"you go there and there\u2019s a massive curb that is only dropped because it\u2019s broke over a stank!","6289":"(Picture below)","6290":"The one way system leads to stairs so you have to head back again which means you can\u2019t socially distance properly and the ramps which  are so steep and uneven I had to actually get out my chair as it was unsafe to go down..","6291":"worth mentioning my chair is electric as well!","6292":"The new panda enclosure also as a black plastic walkway which was held together by metal nails which almost punctured my tires..","6293":"yes the hills are steep, it\u2019s Edinburgh","6294":"but you can still build safe ramps and have proper one way systems that wheelchairs can actually use.","6295":"Mixed feelings about this visit.","6296":"We arrived for our pre booked 11am slot which was pointless as we ended up in a massive queue with people who hadn\u2019t already booked.","6297":"Took about half an hour to get in.","6298":"We then discovered that a lot of the enclosures were closed or empty.","6299":"This was a bit disappointing as there was no mention of this by the entrance staff or on the website.","6300":"Understandably a lot of places can\u2019t open properly due to covid but most places are offering some sort of discount if that\u2019s the case - seems a bit cheeky charging full price for a half open park.","6301":"The covid rules also need to be enforced properly as hardly any of the visitors were social distancing - especially those with kids.","6302":"This made us feel like we just had no time to see anything as we weren\u2019t comfortable with people standing right next to us.","6303":"The little monkey enclosures were fab though and there were lots of places with hand sanitiser.","6304":"Edinburgh Zoo is without a shadow of a doubt a hard work day out as it's built on a slope, that in some parts gets very steep.","6305":"But without a shadow of a doubt its well worth the effort as it's a superb day out.","6306":"It's been a while since our last visit and in that time the chimps have a fantastic new home, endorsed by non other than Jane Goodall, the Tiger enclosure is new and excellent and they are in the process of constructing a new Giraffe habitat.","6307":"There are less animals these days at Edinburgh Zoo compared to say 20 years ago, but thats a positive for us as some of the enclosures were a bit too small really like the old Snow Leopard and Linx enclosures.","6308":"The Penguin cafe was a great stop for a morning coffee and snack overlooking the Penguin enclosure and the Grasslands Restaurant was equally as good for lunch.","6309":"A really great day to be had for all.","6310":"Want to catch Covid-19, visit Edinburgh Zoo at the weekend.","6311":"We are members, so decided to do our first post lockdown visit on a cold, but sunny Sunday afternoon, big mistake.","6312":"Though there are plenty hand sanitising points, and you have to wear mask in the indoor areas, a partial (confusing) one-way system and plenty of notices about 2m distancing, it was crowded and unsafe.","6313":"There were no staff out in the general areas of the zoo, so people were ignoring the one-way system, 2m distancing was 50cm distancing at a lot of places, especially at the Tigers, Lions and the Penguins areas.","6314":"Worst offenders were the parents of superspreaders (children) as they let their kids run riot, and the parents frequently encroached on other peoples space at enclosures, showing zero social responsibility.","6315":"Even heard on 2 seperate occasions, families boast they had come over from Glasgow (Which is in full lockdown), selfish.","6316":"This place is to be avoided, especially at the weekend, unless you want to catch Covid, that is a guarantee here at the moment.","6317":"Get your act together Edinburgh Zoo, start policing the public, they need it.","6318":"This is a great zoo and so much to see.","6319":"The only down side is the climb in this zoo as on a hill, but still well worth the visit as some great animals here.","6320":"The staff were friendly and helpful.","6321":"This zoo was well worth the money.","6322":"Well worth a visit if in The area.","6323":"Me and boyfriend came here for a day out we had lovely weather and all the animals were out and accessible to see there is toilets around and the cafes were open it is a very hilly place thou","6324":"but appart from that I really enjoyed it got loads of photos, in the indoor areas a mask is required to wear just while covid Is going around but if u are unable to wear one just let them know and they are OK with it","6325":"I love zoo's however i found it very disappointing, it was very busy and it was really hard to keep 2m distance and the one way system was very complicated to people just ignoring it.","6326":"There was hardly any animals to be seen, majority of the zoo just seems to be monkeys.","6327":"Awful zoo.","6328":"Have management stopped and seriously looked at this place.","6329":"I have been to many a zoo in my time but this is the worse by far.","6330":"I hate saying that.","6331":"The windows where the monkeys is caked in filth.","6332":"That wasn\u2019t just fresh dirt, that windows that\u2019s never been washed since before lockdown.","6333":"The cold grey concrete place which those poor penguins have to live in is awful.","6334":"I could go on and on","6335":"but I won\u2019t.","6336":"Suffice to say the \u201czoo police\u201d should be checking on the state of the place.","6337":"This has nothing to do with COVID as this place hasn\u2019t seen a lick of paint in years.","6338":"Anyone who says they liked it is either lying or don\u2019t seem to care about the state of the place.","6339":"Clearly they have never been to any other zoo before to compare or they would have had their eyes opened.","6340":"On a plus, the restaurant was clean, staff lovely and COVID friendly","6341":"Absolutely fantastic place, booked a time slot for the weekend, staff were really helpful and friendly.","6342":"So many animals to look round our favourite being the giant panda, absolutely gorgeous, the penguins came a close second.","6343":"Would definitely recommend a visit.","6344":"Food was plentiful and not badly priced.","6345":"Perfect day out\ud83d\ude0a","6346":"Loved the zoo, most things were back open.","6347":"Saw plenty of the animals.","6348":"I\u2019d recommend going earlier in the day as it does get a bit busier throughout.","6349":"Great views from the top too!","6350":"What a fabulous day out.","6351":"Plenty to enjoy and learn about our animal friends.","6352":"The staff were all pleasant and helpful.","6353":"Wasn't fond of the place where the monkeys are kept.","6354":"It's not big enough or stimulating enough for them.","6355":"It made me sad.","6356":"Hopefully this area is on the list for an upgrade.","6357":"The panda was the star of the day.","6358":"The lions were amazing.","6359":"The meerkats were comical.","6360":"Great Zoo, one of the best I have ever been.","6361":"Enclosures are spacious and well thought out.","6362":"Animals all were out enjoying the sun.","6363":"The staff were very knowledgeable and were keen to let visitors know where to get the best view of the Panda who was having a very relaxed midday bamboo snack.","6364":"Seeing  the conservation work and research.","6365":"Brilliant Penguin pool, could have watched them for hours.","6366":"What a sad zoo ,where do I start.","6367":"1. Animals are housed in very basic areas, 2.","6368":"The monkey area has filthy viewing glass which should be cleaned daily, 3.","6369":"Management stated on STV that funds were low which I can understand but surely paint could have been purchased ie all those months of lockdown and a wooden tiger is filthy and chance missed to brighten it up.","6370":"4. Penguin pen is a grey concrete structure...why not have a winter feel or bright??....","6371":"I could go on but as a Scottish person this is a dull , sad embarrassment to the management and sadly to be avoided","6372":"visited for the 1st time today, as amature togs we go to lots of zoos to take photos.","6373":"this zoo is very outdated.","6374":"some of the enclosures are very small and need ripping down and rebuilding, some of the monkey enclosures for example are way behind every other zoo in the uk, the margy enclosure was horrid, as i have said rip this down and build new.","6375":"one of main reasons we visited was pandas, but again viewing wasnt good, europe has fantastic panda enclosures..","6376":"not here though.. big let down.","6377":"was due to have a 2nd day here.. not bothering.","6378":"2 smoking areas which was good except one was in the middle of stinking porta loos....","6379":"not at all hygenic.. wasnt smoking with those round the area, coffee very expensive...all in all not a great zoo and would not waste your money going, glad we used our chester zoo pass to visit, at least it didnt cost anything.","6380":"rhino enclosure also wasnt good, again worst iv ever seen poor things, not up to other zoos standards in the uk thats for sure","6381":"My first ever visit to Edinburgh zoo and probably my last.","6382":"I specifically came for the pandas which I got to see just about but only the male.","6383":"The female was shy and stayed behind the scenes all day.","6384":"The place does need quite alot of TLC as the animal opens looked tired and some animals didn't look happy.","6385":"I saw a few animals but alot was closed.","6386":"There was no information about closures before booked.","6387":"The Covid measures are slim.","6388":"The one way system is difficult to follow and very few hand santisers around.","6389":"Staff were very few and far between.","6390":"The one guy who was at the koala house was fantastic and the panda guy was trying to get people to social distance.","6391":"I know little of Edinburgh zoo funding etc but am local to chester zoo, I feel chester is much better and if it wasnt for the pandas would have been very disappointed.","6392":"The animals and homes need an overhaul.","6393":"Especially as some of the animals were actually Fighting.","6394":"It didn't feel like I got value for money and would recommend checking that they opened more before you go.","6395":"Great day out.","6396":"Loved it.","6397":"Exhibits and animals seem well looked after.","6398":"Glad its back open after being closed for so long","6399":"Good Covid arrangements with a one way system and many hand sanitiser stations and places to wash hands.","6400":"The staff seem engaged and the zoo is well laid out, though some of the uphill sections are a challenge for those less mobile or pushing a pram.","6401":"The exhibits are interesting and it\u2019s possible to get a good view of the animals.","6402":"All in all a pleasant family day out.","6403":"Quite a dead feeling even though it was busy.","6404":"Lots of the cafes and shops were closed maybe because it\u2019s off peak maybe because it\u2019s a Monday.","6405":"There was a really angry manager lady shouting at people that we saw a couple of times around the park shouting at people for not following one way systems but to be fair the systems aren\u2019t great.","6406":"By the tiger area there is no sign of a walkway being one way and we got told to turn around.","6407":"The floor markings are definitely not big or bold enough.","6408":"No one sticks to it.","6409":"I saw one hand sanitiser station around the whole park, maybe we just missed them.","6410":"people still putting hands all over the glass viewing areas.","6411":"Staff just seemed miserable.","6412":"On plus sides it\u2019s a really easy journey \u00a31.80 single on the bus from Edinburgh city centre.","6413":"Lots of animals to see.","6414":"Good that they do a carers ticket.","6415":"My wife and I visited the Zoo and were delighted with the friendliness of everyone working there.","6416":"As a disabled visitor my wife was able to take a mobility bus to the top of the hill to save making our way up the heights.","6417":"On the way up the driver pointed out various things so it was almost like getting a personal guide.","6418":"It was a shame that some of the animals are quite solitary due to the COVID situation","6419":"but they all look very well cared for and were a delight to see.","6420":"The highlight for us had to be the Sumatran Tiger and of course the Giant Panda.","6421":"Was a bit disappointed with the Chimpanzee building as the windows were very dirty (on the inside) which made viewing difficult.","6422":"Overall I would recommend this as a fabulous day out.","6423":"We visited the zoo as a family of 5, all in all a good day.","6424":"However there was a dullness about the place the animals all seemed depressed, miserable and inactive it actually made me quite sad.","6425":"I have visited many zoos and never felt like the animal where sad or miserable however I defiantly got a different feel in this zoo","6426":"It was strange to find all the animals uninterested in there surroundings very minimal activity from all animals the monkeys really upset me they look so Unhappy not 1 of them where up and about they looked so fed up and sad.","6427":"The one way system no one carried out and no one was on hand to manage it so crowds of people were just passing one another at close proximity.","6428":"The zoo itself was amazing, very hilly so be prepared for the walking, but the animals are beautiful and the staff were very helpful.","6429":"However - with the Covid rules there is a one way system in place in some areas, which doesn\u2019t really work as well as it should.","6430":"It made it difficult to get around the zoo easily without missing or repeating certain bits.","6431":"As the pandas are the main attraction it doesn\u2019t make sense to make it one way upwards on a steep hill when people have small children, grandparents etc with them, so if you wanted to revisit them at any point during the day you had to trek the whole way round and up the hill again.","6432":"It seemed a bit contradicting as only some of the walkthrough areas were open whilst others were closed off completely, there were some animals that you couldn\u2019t see at all.","6433":"Overall we did enjoy our trip to this brilliant zoo, but the Covid rules are contradicting in different parts of the zoo.","6434":"amazing zoo with some extraordinary animals!","6435":"all of the animals habitats are perfect for them, especially penguins rock and the koala habitat.","6436":"All social distancing and covid measures done really well, staff everywhere to help with anything.","6437":"This was my first time here since I think 2014.The review title isn\u2019t reflective of the current restrictions and the impact that has.","6438":"I get it.","6439":"Limited numbers and some animal displays\/enclosures are not open.","6440":"It\u2019s hard for everyone.","6441":"The review title is because I was really disappointed with the whole visit Covid aside.","6442":"It feels quite run down and neglected.","6443":"That\u2019s perhaps because of being closed for so long to be fair but it is in desperate need of an overhaul.","6444":"We walked and walked and didn\u2019t really feel like we\u2019d seen much.","6445":"Maybe I\u2019m wrong","6446":"but I seem to remember a lot more animals and displays.","6447":"Even with a 4 year old we were finished and ready to go after 3 hours.","6448":"It feels like a hefty ticket price for that amount.","6449":"Especially when I compare to Blair Drummond which is a similar price and you can easily spend 6-8 hours.","6450":"Avoid this place - no staff at all , DO NOT GO If you have a wheelchair or mobility issues .","6451":"Very over crowded and well over booked , very unsafe during Covid.","6452":"Place is awful biggest waste of money and time","6453":"Terrible experience , especially if you are taking someone who needs a wheelchair .","6454":"Not only was the train that helps off, the hills are high but the surface is all broken with potholes and trying to struggle with a wheelchair whilst getting stuck is impossible .","6455":"The staff are nowhere to be seen and when you do spot one they don\u2019t help.","6456":"Most animals were sleeping or there was zero in the enclosures.","6457":"We were told we could skip queues being in a wheelchair as you need to slowly go down hill and trying to hold a wheeelchair on this was impossible .","6458":"We didn\u2019t get to skip any queues and missed a lot.","6459":"About half of the zoo isn\u2019t accessible to wheelchairs .","6460":"Most toilets are not disabled apart from porta cabins .","6461":"I get there is rules and regulations due to Covid but the zoo was Over filled nobody following the one way rules and no social distance.","6462":"There is ko staff to be seen or enforcing any of this .","6463":"I left exhausted having random people kindly help me out the pot holes .","6464":"My mum who has Alzheimer\u2019s didn\u2019t get to see anything but the penguins .","6465":"I won\u2019t be back and it looks so run down I wouldn\u2019t waste your time, effort or money.","6466":"I would also avoid if you don\u2019t want Covid because they are not following protocol.","6467":"Worst day out","6468":"Disappointing, We arrived shortly after opening time on a wet Friday morning in September, Found the staff in the ticket office less than inspiring, badly signposted around the Zoo , went mainly to see the Pandas as most people who visit do, but to no avail she was asleep in a corridor away from public view, very little else to seen.","6469":"Be warned very steep hills for any one with limited mobility, would difficult pushing a wheel chair around.","6470":"We had a good time today and it was ok weather and the state of the place was rather poor this place isn't local to us and it was a shame to come and it not being amazing the facilities were rather clean and that is it.","6471":"Worth a visit?","6472":"Sure but don\u2019t expect to be wowed like you are in other zoo\u2019s.","6473":"The most popular attraction by far was the penguins and that\u2019s because you didn\u2019t have to spend half an hour hoping to catch a glimpse of them.","6474":"Zero interaction from staff or exhibits.","6475":"No atmosphere, Nothing to make you want to hang around.","6476":"Most of the attractions involve climbing a very steep hill which was a problem for a disabled member of our group, who despite being in a mobility scooter couldn\u2019t see most of the animals as the hill was too strap for the scooter.","6477":"I can\u2019t help but agree with the negative reviews on here atm, we had no preconceived ideas apart from seeing the panda but were incredibly disappointed at the lack of animals on show - to the point that we began joking about the pigeon and squirrel enclosures.","6478":"The panda was also no show!","6479":"The penguins were about the most interesting and lively attraction.","6480":"Although the route was planned out, I would expect that it\u2019s quite difficult for those who are less mobile to negotiate some of the hills here.","6481":"I\u2019m all for keeping going through these difficult times, but at least reduce the cost based on what you have on offer.","6482":"We visited the zoo to try and give them custom to survive these terrible times, but was saddened at the state of the place as a whole, from the lack of life behind the fence\/glass to the non existence of zoo keepers \/ workers.","6483":"We recognise this isnt the norm, but what animals were there looked depressed and weary.","6484":"We truly hope things will get better and look forward to the future.","6485":"The weather was fab at least.","6486":"Our 2nd visit to edinburgh zoo our first being about 5 years ago so wanted to go back and spend a day here as we enjoyed it last time .We","6487":"pre booked online and had to specify a time because of covid to spread out the times and numbers of visitors .","6488":"Masks had to be worn inside but could be taken off whilst outside which was a relief .Our","6489":"favourite part of the zoo is the penguin enclosure and specifically the king penguins , unluckily for us we went up to see the pandas twice","6490":"but they were not playing ball and wernt out which was a shame","6491":"but maybe next time .","6492":"Most animals we saw but had to go back a few times before we saw the rhino as alot of the indoor viewing areas ate closed due to covid so if they wernt out then you didnt get to see them .I must have got more unfit since my last visit but be aware this zoo is built into a slope and has some steep paths and was the main reason we didnt go up to the pandas a third time .Take","6493":"your own food if possible as it's very expensive i got a packet ham salad bread sarnie and it was 5.95 if I remember rightly","6494":".Great","6495":"day at the zoo .","6496":"Always wanted to go to Edinburgh Zoo, expected it to be FULL of Animals and really special, but sadly when we went recently it wasn't like that at all, Maybe it was a bad time to go, but hardly saw any animals, there seemed to be a shortage of them  and what were there were hiding or asleep?, the Surroundings seemed very shabby and there were no food places open, it was one hell of a hike up the hill to see next to nothing, none of the transport was running, including the train...so it was very hard for us older members of the public.","6497":"the only drinks stand charged \u00a35 for 2 standard bottles of drink, a real rip off...will not be rushing back","6498":"Good day out, staff were amazing and informative.","6499":"One way system in place and hand sanitizer everywhere.","6500":"Always worth a visit","6501":"We pre booked this attraction ahead of our visit to Edinburgh which was easy to do via the website, however this was the only positive thing I am able to write about our day.","6502":"Overall the place was very lacklustre.","6503":"We appreciate that due to COVID-19, certain areas were closed, but to be honest we would have seen more animals in a forest.","6504":"We believe that as the zoo was operating with reduced attractions, this should have been reflected in the cost.","6505":"The only animals who were out in force were the penguins.","6506":"Other enclosures were either closed or empty which was so disappointing.","6507":"Sad to say this Zoo is now a shadow of its former self.","6508":"Now living off the Panda's and charging to help pay the Chinese government their hire charges.","6509":"Very poor selection of Animals left there now.","6510":"Many Animals belonging to the Zoo now in the middle of nowhere at the Highland wildlife park which is nowhere in any form an easy access for most of Scotland.","6511":"Prices are high for the very poor experience.","6512":"Ihad a recent visit to Chester Zoo( reasonably easy as I live in the South of Scotland) which is so much better than Edinburgh now the difference is massive.really now only half a Zoo in Edinburgh, you have to travel to the highlands to see the other half.","6513":"Unless you want to see Panda's not worth the bother","6514":"I didn\u2019t want to give a bad review as I know it\u2019s been hard for the zoo due to covid.","6515":"The zoo had to carry on as normal without any money coming in which is a shame but after visiting yesterday I was very disappointed.","6516":"So many of the exhibits were closed which was so disappointing, the one panda they had available to see was nowhere to be seen same with the tigers.","6517":"We were very hungry and went in for lunch only to find that they only accepted card payments when I only had cash so we had to leave the zoo as my granddaughter was so hungry.","6518":"There are no staff interacting with visitors although there were a lot of staff around.","6519":"I think it would be nice if they could take the time and try make conversation or tell us a bit about the animals while cleaning out or whatever.","6520":"The guy who was on the koala exhibit was lovely but he was the only one who actually took the time to be pleasant.","6521":"So basically we paid \u00a344 for two tickets and saw a handful of animals.","6522":"I think the price should be reduced while there is so little to see.","6523":"There is so much more that could be done to make visitors feel welcomed and make the day that bit more special.","6524":"One of the  main reasons for our visit to see the pandas.","6525":"Wasn't disappointed at all.","6526":"Even tho its a treak up the hill to the top to visit them.","6527":"If you have mobility issues you are seriously going to struggle at Edinburgh Zoo.","6528":"Loved the Koalas also.","6529":"Even tho most pens appeared to be empty with no animal still enjoyed our day there.","6530":"Even during a pandemic was impressed how well they had made the zoo safe.","6531":"Would recommend taking your own food and drink as very expensive and not a great deal of choice.","6532":"Hope Edinburgh Zoo manages to stay open.","6533":"It was a lovely day, dry and cool which is very useful when trying to walk up all those hills.","6534":"This was our second visit and booked to coincide with a holiday in Scotland.","6535":"We were able to see the Panda's and Koala's which is a bonus.","6536":"Due to Covid there is a one way system in place around the park which takes a bit of navigating but reduced visitor numbers meant you never felt squeezed.","6537":"The queuing for the Panda's was a little frustrating but worth it to see them.","6538":"It was a nice relaxed day seeing lots of animals and plenty were out to entertain our 2 year old.","6539":"Can't wait to go back.","6540":"We spent the afternoon here yesterday afternoon arriving out our allocated time spot 12 o clockIf you take children 5 and over remember to take them a face mask this is Scottish laws.","6541":"The kolas were lovely to see and we got a great view of the panda.","6542":"There is lots of hills to walk up but ot didn't stop us having a lovely family afternoon altogether.","6543":"I would say the only thing that let this zoo down was the social distancing of the other visitors some of the area mayb could of been maned a bit to assist with this.","6544":"We would visit again and when more of the inclosers are open to walk through","6545":"We visited at our timed slot of 1pm Saturday, there was no queue and we got in immediately.","6546":"I think this was a good time to visit.","6547":"We saw lots of animals, koalas, pandas, chimpanzees, anteaters etc.","6548":"The Staff in the Grasslands restaurant were excellent so kind, helpful and professional.","6549":"The Covid 19 precautions everywhere were very good.","6550":"Everyone did their best to stay distant although you can forget when seeing some of the animals.","6551":"It was a great day out and the penguins were our favourites.","6552":"We enjoyed the zoo especially the Pandas ,koalas and Scottish wildcat.\u2661.","6553":"Wouldn't of seen these animals anywhere else in the UK so had to take the opportunity to see them in real life.","6554":"Nearly missed the Scottish wildcat as it was in its house but came out just as we nearly gave up looking pin the enclosure.","6555":"Extremely rare and I hope they can successfully reintroduce back to Scotland with appropriate protection as often shot by gamekeepers.","6556":"Could be mistaken for a tabby.","6557":"Very good day out.","6558":"Well organised Covid procedures in place although the one-way system means it\u2019s a long walk but understandably this cannot be helped.","6559":"All staff were knowledgeable and shared interesting info regarding Zoo inhabitants.","6560":"Food is expensive (as expected) however, there are no restrictions in place regarding bringing your own picnic.","6561":"Toilets were clean and presentable.","6562":"Managed to see the vast majority of animal inmates including the giant pandas.","6563":"Myself and my fianc\u00e9 came here today and it was great,  either of us had been here in about 15 years so we had no clue what to expect.","6564":"We had a genuinely good time, much more walking than I remembered from being a kid, good one way system, managed to see loads, did want to go back round but couldn\u2019t manage the hill again as I was shattered!!The cafe\/resteaurant was brilliant, we enjoyed the food, the staff where lovely and it was immaculate.","6565":"We will absolutely be back again.","6566":"Had a lovely day out and the weather was perfect","6567":"I visited the zoo with family it was a really enjoyable experience.","6568":"The staff and volunteers where very helpful and polite through out the visit.","6569":"They have got plenty of animals to see my favourite was seeing the big cats and the Scottish wild cat if you can see it as it keeps it self well hiding.","6570":"The animal's have plenty of space and are well looked after.","6571":"It is very well managed for social distancing and there is plenty of signs telling you when you must wear a face mask and there is plenty of hand gel dispensers.","6572":"The staff done a good job of keeping the queues moving for seeing the pandas and koalas.","6573":"the facilities are excellent there's plenty of picnic benches and very clean toilets around the zoo they also have a kids play park next to penguin rock","6574":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo on 02\/09.","6575":"It was an average trip - we've been to several zoos before and this was just OK.","6576":"Not to say it's not worth a visit, but it wasn't anything special.","6577":"Our main tip would be to check the weather beforehand.","6578":"It's already entirely up extremely steep hills, so with slippery wind\/ rain on top, not ideal walking conditions.","6579":"And some bits aren't well signposted at all - the zebras (an animal I'd have thought to be one of the main attractions) were just shoved in a small pen at the very top, where nobody went!The cafes also must signpost better whether you can eat or not.","6580":"There were 3 tables total available, which due to the one-way system, were out of sight until you'd bought food, with no place to eat except for the rainy outdoors, if they were full.","6581":"However, the animals were delightful and so receptive.","6582":"We got so many lovely photos on the camera, and the monkeys and penguins especially seemed to thrive in their environment.","6583":"Quite a few different things to see, most people are here for the pandas, it gets busier the further up the hill you go","6584":"and you\u2019re best heading up there ASAP.","6585":"If you have mobility issues you\u2019ll really struggle to get to the top of the hill, it\u2019s extremely steep in places.","6586":"I have mobility issues and it was quite a feat.","6587":"Like many others are saying, the admission should be slightly reduced to compensate for the lack of talks, and that some indoor experiences being shut.","6588":"The mobility stuff really ruined it for me, as the mobility vehicle was out of use due to covid, and some of the steep hills really stumped me.","6589":"Compared to Chester Zoo, there\u2019s not as much to see, but the enclosures seem to suit the animals needs well.","6590":"Honestly just terrible don\u2019t waste your money.","6591":"Me and my partner went round in a hour.","6592":"Nothing was open.","6593":"There was no atmosphere in the place at all.","6594":"Visited the zoo during a recent stay in Edinburgh.","6595":"Whilst some work had been done to create a one way system, signposting was not always clear and it was difficult to navigate at times.","6596":"Due to the pandemic staffing has been reduced so it was difficult to find people to ask when you were unsure.","6597":"A lot of the viewing areas are closed, which whilst completely understandable, meant larger crowds at other areas and often poor to no visibility of the animals.","6598":"The zoo has many steep inclines and we saw a number of families struggling to push buggies up, particularly in the damp weather so may be an issue for some.","6599":"Probably wouldn\u2019t visit again on any future trips to the city.","6600":"On holiday from England, we decided to visit the FAMOUS Edinburgh Zoo.","6601":"Firstly the covid restrictions were spot on and the staff very helpful and that's were the good bit ends.","6602":"The animals looked sad and not attended too, the ground were cluttered and dirty, the enclosures were filthy and not very well thought out.","6603":"I was so looking forward to it but will never go again or be recommending it.","6604":"Disgusted is not the word.","6605":"My Wife, my 3 year old son and myself went here for the day on bank holiday Monday as we were staying in East Lothian on a short break.","6606":"We had always wanted to go but we were very disappointed.","6607":"First of all it was very expensive to get in.","6608":"Then trying to get parked was a nightmare.","6609":"Drove round and round the car park for 10-15 minutes waiting for a space.","6610":"Once in there, it was a 1 way system with covid safety measures which is a good idea but there should have been more employees giving guidance as to what is open and where it is.","6611":"Most enclosures were empty or you could not see anything.","6612":"A lot of people seemed to be walking around aimlessly like ourselves.","6613":"After an hour, we had enough and decided to get some food before leaving.","6614":"\u00a324 for 2 meal deals of hot dog, chips and drink which were very poor.","6615":"Would recommend the park trying to get more free parking allocations, more employees giving guidance and some better quality food and more reasonable prices.","6616":"We spent a day at Blair Drummond safari park in Stirling whilst on holiday in Scotland and this was a much better day out.","6617":"Well defined routes, better exhibits, more choice of food outlets at a better price and an overall better experience.","6618":"Edinburgh zoo could learn a lot from them.","6619":"Recently visited during a rainy day, it wasn't brilliant","6620":"I spent 4 hours there and saw everything.","6621":"To me it's over priced for what there is.","6622":"I can spend a full day at other zoos for the same price.","6623":"That aside it is a nice zoo and great animals.","6624":"Oh and ponchos \u00a32.50 each after paying \u00a350 to just get in... A bit pricey!","6625":"My partner and I visited here yesterday for the August Bank Holiday weekend and I was surprised how nice this place is.","6626":"The weather was really good which helped with the visit and it is easy to get to by bus from the city centre.","6627":"There is a decent variety of animals to see here, the penguins and koalas definitely the highlight of the visit as the giant pandas were asleep at the time, the staff did make us aware as we were queueing up to see the pandas that they were asleep at the time though, pointing out it is probably not worth the queueing time to see them when they are sleeping, and they were right, don't bother unless they are awake, it was utterly pointless to see a curled up sleeping ball of fur.","6628":"There are quite a few indoor areas open (not all of them, though) which under current circumstances was quite surprising to see.","6629":"A lot is open here right now, and the staff are friendly and doing the best they can with what they have to work with, kudos to them for that.","6630":"They make you aware of social distancing and remind you to obviously not touch anything unless you have to, but after that they leave you to get on with it and enjoy yourself.","6631":"You do have to wear face coverings in the indoor areas but it's no bother, surely by now we should all be used to this anyway.","6632":"The zoo itself is very compact and you can get around it in a half a day and see almost everything, depending on your pace and preferences on what you wish to see.","6633":"The restuarant is closed but there are kiosks open selling basic food and drink, the toilets are clean though currently being used as unisex which personally I find odd and slightly uncomfortable","6634":"so I would recommend using the portable loos instead which are way more private and just as clean.","6635":"The only problems I faced during my visit are not really the fault of the zoo, which are the hills the zoo is built on.","6636":"They are frequent and very steep.","6637":"People with mobility issues will suffer here, the hills are relentless and often and it does subtract from the fun of the visit somewhat.","6638":"If you have a serious disability I wouldn't come here at all, it would be a constant struggle.","6639":"The queues at busy times can also be frustrating considering it wasn't particularly busy during my time here, they would eat up too much time on a busy day for sure but blame the government for that one.","6640":"Obviously, there are families and children aplenty here, and like the majority of families on a day out, they are totally unaware of their surroundings and responsibilities as human beings to maintain a safe social distance.","6641":"This is not the fault of the zoo, as they do remind everyone about current circumstances and guidelines, but it is not enforced, so I found myself on multiple occasions having to bite my tongue with the more ignorant families that are around.","6642":"The zoo is very clean and there are plenty of hand sanitiser stations around, so no concerns there.","6643":"Even in the Covid era, this is probably my favourite zoo, despite the fact it is hard work to walk around because of the sheer steepness of it, it is not fully open and there are some blatantly obvious omissions due to construction and part closures.","6644":"It was a very pleasant day out and the staff have done the absolute best they can do right now.","6645":"I would go back again when it is fully open.","6646":"Edinburgh zoo have done a very good job post lockdown to ensure the safety of its visitors whilst still maintaining the level of experience you expect.","6647":"They have set out a one way system to maintain distancing where required and certain walkthroughs aren\u2019t available but still plenty to visit and do.","6648":"Although the play parks are busy it\u2019s not necessary to stop at these bits but there is hand sanitizer available there if kids stop to play.","6649":"Cafe is operating one way system and there is a few kiosks opening for coffee\/snacks and ice cream.","6650":"As well as few food vans on site.","6651":"Saw lots of animals I'd never seen before, including the Koalas, Scottish wildcat & Giant Pandas (just about got to see","6652":"these-","6653":"they're very lazy and tend to just be asleep in their beds).","6654":"Free parking for time being as it should be during this climate of Coronavirus restrictions...firstly it's very much down to luck if your mandatory pre booked admission day is dry and if your favourite animal is going to be awake and making themselves visible to you..","6655":"so please bear this in mind when you go..it's not cheap but can understand there are lots of costs in the general upkeep of a zoo..","6656":"so prices are going to reflect this...so due to the social distancing climate and despite wearing masks in the indoor areas you have to keep flow of people traffic moving in one direction...you can't wait a little longer for that Monkey or Panda or Tiger or whatever to decide to grace us with a proper glimpse of their presence as you are reminded by staff to keep moving to allow others behind in queues to get a chance...despite this we made the best of it as weather was dry and allowed grandkids to run in play areas and enjoy picnic in one of the many areas provided..lots of toilets which had to be entered \"one troop\" at a time...kids were desperate to spend their gifts of money from relatives but queue for gift shop at the end of our visit was too long and couldn't have been accessed until end due to one way system in place..ordered gifts from online Edinburgh Zoo shop..","6657":"so to sum it up..","6658":"it's pot luck on the day what you will experience..","6659":"your admission cost is for the animals upkeep basically....would have been awful on a wet day..","6660":"If you're able bodied, the zoo is OK.","6661":"Be prepared for long queues for the star attractions (we didn't see the pandas as the line was too long).","6662":"The zoo is quite hilly so be ready for a trek.","6663":"But if you're disabled then don't bother.","6664":"Lack of dropped curbs throughout the zoo, bumpy pothole road, and not thought out areas.","6665":"We got into the pelican enclosure OK, but couldn't get out because the gates open inwards and there's not enough space to open the gate when you've got a wheelchair \/ scooter in there.","6666":"Having to struggle through the gates with a mobility scooter while people were forced to wait and a queue formed behind us was a bit embarrassing TBH.Lots shut because of covid, which also made it a bit expensive for what we saw.","6667":"Head to the safari park in Stirling instead.","6668":"Booked to come here as on holiday in Dunbar.","6669":"It's on a very steep hill so be prepared for that.","6670":"One way system round that was well signposted and very organised.","6671":"Loved the animals and the enclosures.","6672":"Happened to be in an indoor section (cant remember the name) just at the right time to see a keeper coax an armadillo from his tunnel to be weighed, that was fascinating and she was very knowledgeable and told us about the enclosure and other facts.","6673":"Queued and hour to see the pandas sleeping in the corners, did mind as they were so cute.","6674":"There was a man walking the queue with a beard, he was fab.","6675":"Making sure people knew the eta for queue and that the pandas were asleep, he organised it well.","6676":"Queued about 30 mins for the koalas, they are so cute.","6677":"Both worth the queues.","6678":"Penguin section the best, king penguins are stunning.","6679":"Got to see feeding time, all have their little characters.","6680":"Watched them for ages.","6681":"We ate in the grasslands restaurant near penguin enclosure, really nice food and again well organised with the social distancing.","6682":"All in all, despite the rain, an amazing day out.","6683":"We cant wait to come back again.","6684":"Booked to come here as on holiday in Dunbar.","6685":"It's on a very steep hill so be prepared for that.","6686":"One way system round that was well signposted and very organised.","6687":"Loved the animals and the enclosures.","6688":"Happened to be in an indoor section (cant remember the name) just at the right time to see a keeper coax an armadillo from his tunnel to be weighed, that was fascinating and she was very knowledgeable and told us about the enclosure and other facts.","6689":"Queued and hour to see the pandas sleeping in the corners, did mind as they were so cute.","6690":"There was a man walking the queue with a beard, he was fab.","6691":"Making sure people knew the eta for queue and that the pandas were asleep, he organised it well.","6692":"Queued about 30 mins for the koalas, they are so cute.","6693":"Both worth the queues.","6694":"Penguin section the best, king penguins are stunning.","6695":"Got to see feeding time, all have their little characters.","6696":"Watched them for ages.","6697":"We ate in the grasslands restaurant near penguin enclosure, really nice food and again well organised with the social distancing.","6698":"All in all, despite the rain, an amazing day out.","6699":"We cant wait to come back again.","6700":"Very Disappointed, our youngest is Panda mad, this is the reason we went to the zoo.","6701":"It was our First visit, and will be the last visit.","6702":"Not many animals to be seen.it looked run down and looked very over grown, making what animals that were out hard to see.","6703":"The zoo itself is set on a very very steep hill, which would not suit everyone.","6704":"Lots of areas closed.","6705":"I  think Quite pricey for the fact that they didn't seem to be many animals.","6706":"We completed it within 2 hours, including our picnic.","6707":"They wasn't much social distancing going on at the zoo in areas, they seemed to be quite a lot of people at the zoo, to say you booked a time slot .","6708":"On a good note, the staff we came aross were friendly, they seemed to be lot's of hand sanitizer, snd i saw staff going around cleaning high touch point areas.","6709":"We also saw the male panda only from the back, has he was to busy eating is bamboo, to look at everyone.","6710":"\ud83d\udc3c.","6711":"MANY SECTIONS CLOSED, SHOULD BE HALF PRICEThe worst zoo we have ever visited.","6712":"Family of 4 (children 9 and 14) we booked for midday.","6713":"We were shocked at how few animals we could see, half way around we had seen flamingos, pigeons, a crow and a wallabee.","6714":"All of the enclosures looked the same - muddy, boggy, with a few logs thrown in.","6715":"So many of the viewing points were closed off the zoo should have a reduced ticket price to reflect this.","6716":"We got round the whole zoo in a few hours, including eating the lunch we bought, children were disappointed with the lack of animals and the theme of the afternoon was \" nothing to see in this enclosure\" the animals we did see looked sad.","6717":"The two enclosures you can actually see animals are monkeys and penguins, the rest of the park was mostly empty.","6718":"We live near the south lakes wildlife park and that is so much better and there, the animals have alot more space and look happy and stimulated.","6719":"There staff and constantly visible looking after animals and they do talks and feeding demos.","6720":"Edinburgh Zoo looks run down and tired.","6721":"We didn't see the pandas as the queue was HUGE.","6722":"Much smaller than expected and hardly any animals, children disappointed.","6723":"No talks, no demos, no staff visible.","6724":"We wouldn't visit again, mostly because the animals did not look well looked after.","6725":"The zoo visit was good despite the awful weather.","6726":"The signage was clear and the measures in place were good.","6727":"Their was quite a queue getting in but it moved fairly fast and their was a long queue to see the pandas which wasn\u2019t fun in the rain but we will definitely go again.","6728":"Fab day out with lots of amazing animals.","6729":"Very well organised for the current situation.","6730":"Quite large queues for pandas and koalas but so worth the wait.","6731":"Visited with a specific time slot so thought it wouldn't be too busy - I was wrong.","6732":"The place was packed - there were so many people that you could hardly see into many of the enclosures.","6733":"There were queues for lots of things too.","6734":"We didnt bother visiting the pandas as the queue was so long.","6735":"There was very little social distancing but lots of hand sanitizing stations.","6736":"I actually ended up wearing my mask around most of the zoo because people were too close.","6737":"We also didnt see many animals, no lions or tigers, and a few enclosures were closed.","6738":"I do realise though that you cant guarantee seeing all the animals but the ticket was pretty pricey","6739":"so I just dont feel it was worth the price.","6740":"Lovely zoo, but it's on a hill which may not be suited for everyone.","6741":"Plenty to see and do and fun for people of all ages","6742":"Very good zoo with lots of animals.","6743":"Lots of hand sanitising stations around and staff encouraging social distancing.","6744":"Although it was a very rainy day and we had to queue for some of the animals the staff kept you updated on queue times and what the animals were doing so you could leave and come back later.","6745":"Are in the grasslands cafe and food was good and came quickly.","6746":"Not well signpostedVery little interaction from staff, very few staff on site.","6747":"Any zoo you can walk around everything in 2 hours is crap.","6748":"Boring and dirty enclosures.","6749":"Uninspiring.","6750":"Even our children couldn't wait to leave.","6751":"The most exciting part of the zoo was buying a coffee!!Not a patch on Chester zoo","6752":"Words cannot describe me and my partners weekend in Edinburgh, let alone our Saturday 22nd","6753":"August trip to Edinburgh Zoo.","6754":"As a City we absolutely loved it, and the Zoo made it ten times better for us.","6755":"We are Panda followers and have been for years.","6756":"The Panda cams during lockdown for myself have really helped me get through an emotional and tough 6 months of being at home, with various family and personal issues.","6757":"So thank you very much!So the trip made it even more worthwhile.","6758":"The staff were brilliant, very knowledgeable, especially Charlie.","6759":"We spoke to him and got to know about the pandas  more than we would looking for panda facts online.","6760":"A brilliant guy, who answered every question with a lot of info, he really surprised us and it has been said in other reviews he loves his job, and we are so envious of him spending his working day with the Tian Tian and Yang Guang.","6761":"It really was an unforgettable experience for my and my partner, and we are still coming down off cloud nine as it has had a massive impact on us, and cannot wait for the 2nd trip again.","6762":"We hope the Zoo gets to keep them longer than this year!!","6763":"They are letting bookings in at certain times and have a system to go round the zoo.","6764":"This means lots of people are entering at same time so all the enclosures at start are just overly busy as your supposed to follow the same direction.","6765":"Not much really happening there and not much to see.","6766":"Especially when it's raining.","6767":"No options for money back since you need to book before going now, so check your crystal ball before you go.","6768":"Loved our day in the zoo.","6769":"Daughter was over the moon about seeing the pandas and koalas.","6770":"Lots of other interesting beasties too.","6771":"We got absolutely drenched in the weather, we all had waterproof jackets but jeans don't like rain.","6772":"The staff were very friendly and were doing their best.","6773":"As is sometimes the case,  the public were a challenge,  especially getting barged by someone behind us impatiently waiting for us to move on.","6774":"Free parking and the eat out to help out system was a real bonus too.","6775":"Highly recommended.","6776":"We were really looking forward to visiting and were prepared for some changes to normal zoo visiting, but the queues were akin to theme parks.","6777":"Prepare for a long queue to get in, then all popular animals had a 30-40 minute queue.","6778":"Lots of enclosures were closed as well.","6779":"The staff were doing their best, but would recommend avoiding currently.","6780":"The title says it all.","6781":"The staff try their best but Covid means this place can\u2019t really open as a visitor attraction.","6782":"The constant adding and removing of masks.","6783":"The never ending list of closures now closed off...birds, lemurs, monkeys, rhinos, hippos, zebras.","6784":"The actual zoo looks the part and the enclosures are big, it has some amazing animals and experiences.","6785":"I know if I visited again, this would get a higher score.","6786":"Make your decision on what you wish to see","6787":"Our family group of three generations had a most enjoyable day.","6788":"Yes it is a steep climb and a few limitations due to Covid but the wonderful staff made up for it.","6789":"They were extremely cheerful and informative and tried hard to encourage visitors to stick to the one way system.","6790":"We have been to Edinburgh zoo a number of times but this was the first since lockdown has eased.","6791":"The measures implemented by the zoo were very disappointing.","6792":"While there was good use of hand sanitizers around the park and the booking system worked well, the one way system was completely ineffective and not enforced.","6793":"It\u2019s such a shame when so many people are trying to stick to the rules but others think they don\u2019t need to abide by them.","6794":"We had to walk away from some of the animal enclosures because other groups got too close (millimetres away.)","6795":"Came here during a visit to Edinburgh really enjoyed myself loved seeing the koala bears and the pandas.","6796":"Highly recommend coming here.","6797":"Totally worth a visit, very helpful staff, free parking at the minute is a bonus.","6798":"There is ample space and the one way system in place is good, just a pity brainless people don't follow it.","6799":"Some very rude people visiting which isn't the fault of the venue","6800":"We came to visit the zoo for the first time.","6801":"The queuing system to get in and masks required followed COVID regulations.","6802":"There were arrows directing you but to be fair not everyone followed them.","6803":"The toilets were a nightmare due to one in one out.","6804":"There is lots to see but all the regulations did put me off a little as I was very conscious of all the people.","6805":"There were lots of animals out but a few areas were closed.","6806":"The queue for the giant panda was huge so we gave that a miss.","6807":"This is one of the hilliest, steepest zoos I\u2019ve ever been too.","6808":"If you struggle with hills this isn\u2019t the zoo for you.","6809":"I\u2019m not super fit if I\u2019m honest and it was a struggle.","6810":"There are lots of benches on the way up so you can stop.","6811":"The penguin area is great.","6812":"Lots of penguins and it\u2019s really spacious.","6813":"I\u2019ve obviously never been outside COVID so only can base it on that and it may be very different normally.","6814":"It\u2019s not a bad zoo","6815":"but it wasn\u2019t my favourite.","6816":"The entire day we were there it was horrendous, torrential rain.","6817":"Even with that it was still a good day and added bonus the rhinos seem to enjoy it.","6818":"We have been in Edinburgh for a week and have been out every day.","6819":"We have seen restrictions elsewhere handled incredibly well with a number of different strategies in place to keep customers safe.","6820":"We booked the tickets at the start of the week and were pleased that the tickets were timed tickets, presuming this to avoid large queues and crowds of people.","6821":"This was not the case at all.","6822":"We arrived at our allotted time of 11:00 to find a rather long queue with very little social distancing happening, despite markers.","6823":"I am not sure how many people were in the queue but the end was roughly where the toilets in the car park, towards the electric charging points, zigzagged in this area and then led down the ramp, around the corner and eventually into the building.","6824":"To be fair, we reached the front relatively quickly considering there were easily well over 150 people (half an hour) there was a constant stream of people joining the queue.","6825":"I had presumed that timed tickets were allocated to avoid this situation.","6826":"At the desk, we mentioned this to the young man and his answer was something along the lines of the zoo being within the guidelines for the maximum amount of visitors during the day.","6827":"We didn\u2019t press this point as it was not his fault and he had many people yet to deal with.","6828":"I understand that, within the grounds, most of the area is outdoors and so it is easier to keep a distance but the large gathering at the start was not helpful.","6829":"The member entrance was closed and everyone with a ticket had to queue together.","6830":"Just a thought but perhaps splitting booking times into two groups might have helped reduce the crowd (Admittedly, it was my first visit and so I am not entirely sure of the full layout of the building and entrances)Maybe different entrances for on the hour and another for half past or only a certain number of actually timed tickets per entrance?","6831":"We saw no hand sanitiser at the start (which I believe would the message straight away that we should use them) but we did see some from perhaps about half way around.","6832":"We were told that there was a one way system but we found this difficult to navigate as the markers were not very clear and we felt like we were walking around in loops.","6833":"Many people were not following any one way system and were not keeping to the side as signs instructed.","6834":"(Ok, so this is not the fault of the zoo but, the gathering at the start didn\u2019t help with the safe distance message.)","6835":"The zoo itself was fine, although there seemed to be quite a few areas closed with signs stating that it was to keep us safe, presumably COVID related.","6836":"Ironic, considering the mob of people queuing to get in.","6837":"As I said at the start, we have seen some excellent practice at other attractions and so realise that it is not impossible.","6838":"Actual staggered and monitored timings would have been useful.","6839":"If the zoo wants to ensure they get their number quota for the day, maybe they could extend opening times an hour earlier and an hour later.","6840":"The low rating is mainly because of these failings.","6841":"I was very excited to visit the zoo whilst I\u2019m edinburgh as I had never been and was excited to see different animals and it was my birthday.","6842":"Unfortunately the rating is average just because of a few areas, some down to the zoo and some just down to bad luck unfortunately.","6843":"It rained so heavy all day, that hardly any animals were out.","6844":"There were lack of signs stating that you could get plastic rain covers, and because it\u2019s a one way system and couldn\u2019t go in the gift shop until the end of our visit, I couldn\u2019t go back to get one.","6845":"So it was a very soppy and cold wet walk round the zoo.","6846":"They have tried to do a one way system but when you have several different pathways to different animals it just doesn\u2019t work, the signs are difficult to read and many a time just kept circling round and round the same two animal pens.","6847":"Unfortunately only got to see a blob of a sleeping panda, but saw two lovely koala bears, one asleep and one awake.","6848":"Was glad the indoor parts were open to get out of the rain and saw a lovely baby chimp.","6849":"Unfortunately didn\u2019t get to see many animals as their indoor enclosures didn\u2019t have windows or were fogged up or too dirty to see into, or closed altogether such as the pigs, otters, hippo, rhino...","6850":"one entire area we walked round there was just no animals.","6851":"I also understand Covid, but there were no places at all for any food or a hot drink, and when we got to the penguins which luckily like they rain and we saw a lot of them, we saw one cafe open.","6852":"We waited about 5 mins for the lady to tell us we weren\u2019t guaranteed a table any time soon and to leave, but we stayed and we got a table 2 mins later so good job","6853":"we stuck it out.","6854":"Menu was small but better than nothing - burger and chips, pizza, falafel burger, fries, and then some hot and cold drinks - we had the dine in August offer so it was only \u00a312 for 2 mains and two large drinks which is very good for zoo food and the food was above average.","6855":"Unfortunately the cafe had no heating and the dryer was broken so couldn\u2019t dry anything off.","6856":"There were at least another 3\/4 cafes and restaurant we saw that we\u2019re letting some people take away a quick coffee but nobody wants to walk around in the pouring rain, one cafe open isn\u2019t enough.","6857":"Managed to see the 3 teen\/cubs so close up as they were hanging around the fences and they were lovely.","6858":"If we hadn\u2019t of seen the lions and the koalas I think it would of just been an ok day, I know the rain isn\u2019t the zoos fault but direction of the zoo was difficult and almost gave up trying to see a few of the animals due to being stuck going round in circles.","6859":"Also lots and lots of very steep hilly climbs so I don\u2019t recommend those disabled or wheelchair users.","6860":"Gift shop had a nice selection and staff nice.","6861":"Got there at 10 and left around 2.30I hope one day I can go back and experience a much better day at the zoo.","6862":"Good time with family of teens and tweens.","6863":"Pandas were a highlight.","6864":"Daughter loved penguins and enclosure was large so nice to see.","6865":"Excellent on hygiene rules.","6866":"My partner and I visited the zoo 07:08:2020.","6867":"Our visit was to see the pandas and our sons message on the sponsorship cards.","6868":"A friend organised for a special tour with a member of your staff.","6869":"Charlie met us at 13:00 and stayed with us throughout the day and took us our sons message.","6870":"Charlie was amazing and really took his time to explain every animal we past.","6871":"His knowledge was immense and you can see he clearly loves his job.","6872":"Planning more visits in the near future with family and friends.","6873":"Thank you Charlie and Edinburgh zoo for amemorable day.","6874":"Always a favourite place to go.","6875":"Staff are excellent and the changes made after this pandemic are excellent.","6876":"I actually prefer going now as its not too busy !!","6877":"Good day at the zoo for a family with a 3 year old and a 1 year old.","6878":"Covid-19 precautions meant everyone arrived around the same time and then had to work round a one way system.","6879":"It worked to a point but it meant everyone was travelling in the same direction and some enclosures were busy and a few queues to get into the few inside bits that were open.","6880":"The directional arrows were not that great and we missed a bit and had to work back round.","6881":"It is very hilly which is hard work for a 3 year old and pushing the pram was interesting!","6882":"Lots of animals to see and a few park areas for the kids to play in.","6883":"The food at grasslands was actually pretty good - we had pizzas which were tasty.","6884":"Overall a great day out.","6885":"It is expensive to get in but they are a charity so don't mind so much.","6886":"My kids loved it, especially the penguins.","6887":"So did we.","6888":"There is a lot not on because of Covid-19 so be aware before you visit.","6889":"Definitely worth a visit.","6890":"With covid restrictions in place we were unsure of how our day would go, but the one way system worked really well and it meant you got to see everything.","6891":"The que for the pandas was a bit nuts and I\u2019m not sure I\u2019d do it again, but the rest was great and not too many people.","6892":"A really great little zoo!","6893":"It was a decent visit to the zoo because of the rain most of the animals were hiding so only saw a few.","6894":"It was quite a small zoo so didn\u2019t have that many exotic animals, so probably more enjoyable for first time zoo goers or children.","6895":"We would recommend as it probably would of been good on a sunny day.","6896":"Due to COVID-19 it may of seemed smaller as some exhibits were shut, so we\u2019re giving it the benefit of the doubt.","6897":"We had a lovely day at the Zoo.","6898":"Social distancing measures and one way systems were clear and it all felt safe with a good amount of animals available to see.","6899":"We spent the full day and followed staff advice to go back later for some of the queues (Chimpanzees, pandas etc.)The Zoo is quite hilly so we did plenty of steps!","6900":"Booking slots means everyone turned up at the same time.","6901":"So big queues to get in.","6902":"Spent a lot of time looking at seemingly empty enclosures.","6903":"Many of the walk-throughs were shut.","6904":"Long queue to see Pandas (40m plus queuing in the rain) most facilities seemed closed.","6905":"Heavy rain meant that most of the animals were hiding.","6906":"Feel that ticket prices should have been discounted for the compromises.","6907":"No opportunity for refund or to move tickets to another day.","6908":"We really enjoyed our time here.","6909":"The entrance to the zoo is beautiful.","6910":"We had great fun looking at all the animals and in aw over the enclosures for a lot.","6911":"The red pandas have vast trees to climb with tones of space.","6912":"We watched the cheeky chimps which was good fun as they were behaving badly (although it seems there was definitely a ring leader terrorising the group running and pushing the others) there is a bit of a que getting into the chimps but purely due to keeping everyone safe and not over crowding the indoor space.","6913":"One thing to note is any disability\u2019s (hidden, use your sunflower lanyard or disability ID card) you can go to the front.","6914":"I didn\u2019t have my lanyard as didn\u2019t think it would be \u2018excepted\u2019 but didn\u2019t expect to be in so many ques lol.","6915":"I did however have my disability ID card showing I struggle standing","6916":"and they were great.","6917":"The chimps, the koala and giant pandas had the longest ques.","6918":"Everything else I was ok to wait.","6919":"The zoo is a labyrinth as so much is there","6920":"but you can easily miss parts.","6921":"Many many hills and steep slopes (by the point of battling cobbles and slopes through Edinburgh it because a standing joke) but all in all was a wonderful day.","6922":"I really really hope all Zoos are able to bounce back safely and quickly.","6923":"A good day out to Edinburgh zoo.","6924":"Tickets were approximately \u00a390 for a family of 5.","6925":"We booked around 5 weeks in advance.","6926":"Arrived to quite a large queue to get in.","6927":"Rather unfriendly staff member directing the crowd.","6928":"Limited social distancing in the queue.","6929":"One-way system in place which meant we missed out on the walk through monkey enclosure as the queue would have been around 45 minutes.","6930":"Good playground for the children to play on.","6931":"Toilets were port-a-loos with no running water to wash hands afterwards \ud83e\udd2eFood options were fairly limited and we regretted not taking a picnic.","6932":"We got sandwiches in The Penguin Caf\u00e9 which cost \u00a330 for 2 adults and 3 children.","6933":"The pandas were amazing.","6934":"Queued for an hour in total to see 1 inside and 1 outside.","6935":"A good zoo but very steep hills so not sure how easy it would be for someone with mobility issues.","6936":"Having arrived at the Zoo we were told about the one way systems which were clearly marked out with signs and arrows (although many people seemed to not understand what no entry meant).","6937":"Managed to see everything that we were able to see with no issues, staff were on hand to stop people from overcrowding certain areas, only down side was the limited food options especially for vegan\/dairy intolerances.","6938":"Overall a good day out, would advise to go early to avoid the queues.","6939":"We had a lovely day out at the Zoo.","6940":"When we arrived we were told what how the Zoo is a one way system and was given a map that clearly states ypur route.","6941":"However we did our reading up on the zoo before hand and new this and that some eateries would not be open so we took our own lunch and drinks.","6942":"Please note that if you Take a water bottle there are two stations you can fill this one as you first enter the park  you won t miss this on the left as this is also a sanitizing area, the other at the top picnic area.","6943":"Plenty of toilets open and porta loos as well as sanatizing stations.","6944":"There was a part of the zoo that was closed off but hey this is due to a new giraffe enclosure being built.","6945":"There is a steep incline to get to the top of the zoo but nothing like how it used to be as they have clearly made this a zigzag path and you don't really notice just how steep it really is.","6946":"Who needs a gym!!!!","6947":"There are plenty of places to sit and to have a picnic and a nice sized play area for the children.","6948":"There are plenty of animals to see as well as different plant species and birds.","6949":"You do have a wait in line for the more popular attractions, Panda, Koalas, Rhinos but your not in a hurry your there to chill out and enjoy yourself and it's worth it.","6950":"Leaving the park you have two options stand waiting to get into the zoo shop or just go straight out of the zoo.","6951":"All in all it was an enjoyable day and at no point did I feel uncomfortable in these uncertain times.","6952":"The zoo had made it easy for all to get around and we would definately go back.","6953":"I'm really gutted to be leaving a two star review but sadly this is the maximum I can give for this visit.","6954":"We went as a family of three with a four year old for her first visit to the zoo.","6955":"I had booked online and was aware that there would be some restrictions in terms of what was open and mechanisms in place to manage crowds given the , still very real, threat of COVID-19 transmission.","6956":"The reality is that very few inside spaces are open.","6957":"So, on the hottest day of the year, most of the animals were rightly inside and out of the sun and we didn't see them.","6958":"There were no staff around to manage the crowds (although to be fair, adults shouldn't need telling twice).","6959":"So despite the advice given at the admissions desk, very few people were observing social distancing measures and those of us that were were made to feel uncomfortable and rushed.","6960":"There are only two areas in the park that have drinks for sale and nowhere to be able to fill a water bottle.","6961":"We had brought food and drinks with us but, as I say, it was the hottest day of the year and there was no opportunity for respite from the sun so it would have been good to have a couple of extra drinks carts dotted about.","6962":"I understand that the zoo is a charity and I have donated over the course of the pandemic, however I don't think it is reasonable to be charging full price for tickets and I think there should be full disclosure on the website re what is open and what is not - as in a note on the map so you can judge for yourself the time it will take to go round and if it is worth it.","6963":"I also think there needs to be more staff on site as the lack of social distancing made for a very unpleasant and anxious visit.","6964":"First disappointment was the car park was full, so parked out front with everyone else and came back to a parking ticket for being 10 minutes late back to the car.","6965":"Second dissapointment was profitering from masks - did you know you need to wear a mask from age 5 in Scotland?","6966":"Don't worry, we are that concerned about it we are selling masks for \u00a37.50 for the kids,A lot of walk ways and things were closed off.","6967":"Toliet facilities were not split by gender, all pile in the one wash room.","6968":"Difficult with children and considerable worse for the spread of Covid-19 than opening a full compliment of wash room facilities.","6969":"The play areas and picnic areas are nice for some respite.","6970":"Panda enclosure is great but better to see outside than queue up to see inside.","6971":"Rhinos are fantasic to see but sad to see them in such a small enclosure.","6972":"All in all our experience was frustrating.","6973":"Seeing the Panda was the best bit but this Zoo isn't a patch on Chester.","6974":"Enjoyed the pandas, tapir, koalas and penguins.","6975":"Felt zoo was quite overgrown - not sure if normal or just post lockdown.","6976":"No staff about to ask questions about animals and seems a lot of things closed.","6977":"Enjoyed seeing the pandas.","6978":"Coffee at the penguin cafe was worth it.","6979":"The zoo was a lovely way to spend our last day in Edinburgh!","6980":"We got there for midday and there was a long queue but it does go down fast so dont worry about that!","6981":"The range on animals is very vast and for its a chance to see the only Giant Pandas in the UK!","6982":"There are toilets every now and then as well as places to buy food and drink!","6983":"The only thing I would take into consideration is that it is built on a hill so it does involve going up an incline but its not too steep.","6984":"The meaurements that have bee put in place during the pandemic is wonderful; there are hand santisers very frequently, only so many people can enter the same building at one time such as to see the koalas and monkeys and during inside areas masks are required.","6985":"They have also put in place a one way system throughout the park so there arent many areas of crossing over with other people.","6986":"The queue for the pandas is an hour long, to see 2 sleeping animals.","6987":"Everywhere you go there are queues and very little to see.","6988":"Totally overpriced.","6989":"Avoid.","6990":"\u00a350+ for tickets to see two monkeys and a few flamingos.","6991":"Most areas were closed off so couldn\u2019t get in to see anything.","6992":"Areas that were open were missing animals or had huge queues, which with a toddler, were impossible.","6993":"None of us enjoyed the day.","6994":"Front of staff were great, but other staff we encountered weren\u2019t very friendly, especially in cafe.","6995":"Nothing quite like climbing that massive hill to see the big cats, and not seeing any at all.","6996":"Thank god for the two Zebras on the way back down.","6997":"Sadly fond memories of the zoo have been tainted.","6998":"Either discount tickets or open enclosures.","6999":"Not fair to charge full price for half the experience.","7000":"Visited with grandchildren.","7001":"Here are the negatives and theres plenty of them.","7002":"Many enclosures not open.","7003":"No giraffes, elephants, reptiles, small insects to name a few.","7004":"Access to many of the enclosures closed or with restricted views.","7005":"The entire area around footpaths untidy and overgrown with weeds leading to an unkempt appearance.","7006":"Then there is the cafes.","7007":"No hot food and grossly overpriced.","7008":"Cold cans of coke etc \u00a32-3Small tub of ice cream again \u00a32-3The hot food is \u00a312 a burger.","7009":"Four adults and three kids = \u00a384.","7010":"Who in their right mind is willing to pay that.","7011":"Overall a horrendous experience and NOT worth the cost.","7012":"Yes the little ones loved seen the animals but that was the only positive from a very expensive Sunday outing.","7013":"My advice would be save your money and enjoy the National Musuem at no cost and give the kids \u00a340 pocket money","7014":"We visited on a very wet and windy day and were concerned at first that the very hilly site would be a bit of a nightmare, but we soon got used to marching up and down the paths that were rapidly turning into streams and had a fab day.","7015":"At first we were concerned about a lack of attention to the covid security arrangements, particularly in the busy Panda and Koala centres, but despite a few people not knowing the meaning of social distancing it was mainly fine.","7016":"I think the weather actually helped, because by 3pm most people seemed to have given up and gone home and we virtually had the place to ourselves for the last two hours - then the animals that had been holed up in their shelters started to come out!We loved seeing the pandas and koalas, but the absolute highlight were the penguins - we watched them being fed by hand and to see how lovingly the keepers did that was really nice.","7017":"All in all a very good day out, the food was overpriced, but that\u2019s fairly typical, the staff we encountered were lovely and the animals were great.","7018":"It must have been good as we spent six hours there in the pouring rain!","7019":"The zoo has tried to be organised for social distancing.","7020":"However a number of visitors not following 1 way system.","7021":"Signs clearly say one troop at a time at viewing windows\/platforms.","7022":"Found it frustrating when we patiently wait in que, sometimes lengthy,  allowing people in front the space to enjoy looking at animals while others just pile on, squeeze in with no consideration.","7023":"We gave up after 2 hours even though we had not seen few animals we had been looking forward to.","7024":"We were there on a really warm sunny day so maybe people stayed longer but it was a bit of a disappointment.","7025":"Not the zoo itself, but the experience.","7026":"Suppose the trouble is not all people like to follow rules even if it for our safety!!","7027":"We came on holiday to Scotland and as we both love animals and photography we thought this was the perfect place to combine the both.","7028":"We pre booked two weeks before and sadly the weather wasn't on our side.","7029":"We were very disappointed that a lot of the enclosures were closed to visitors as it was many more than it stated in their website.","7030":"Due to the rain a lot of the animals were inside (don't blame them as it was wet and windy)","7031":"but then you couldn't see them as the indoor enclosures were closed to the public.","7032":"Given how much of it wasn't open we would of thought the tickets would of been discounted to accommodate that fact.","7033":"Drinks were ridiculously overpriced....","7034":"\u00a32.65 for a 500ml bottle of Coke.","7035":"My favourite part was the chimpanzee house, it was lovely.","7036":"The lion's were so cute.","7037":"Saw three members a staff, one was at the chimp house, one at the pandas and one at the lions.","7038":"I understand that the keepers talks have been postponed due to Covid-19 but having a few at the enclosures that were open so you can ask questions if you have any.","7039":"People ignoring the one way system, this isn't the zoo's fault but barriers or staff dotted around reminding people that it's one way would help.","7040":"Went to use the hand sanitiser at one station and it was empty.","7041":"All in all it was a fine day out just wish there were more enclosures open or at least a warning that they would be closed.","7042":"The weather didn't help but that is out of their control.","7043":"At least on a sunny day you could sit out and relax a bit.","7044":"The zoo is situated on a hill, and the one-way paths allow us to keep our distances.","7045":"A map is provided at the entrance and you can go see the animals in the order that you want.","7046":"You can stop for a coffee and a donut on the way up Costorphine Hill, and the view is worth the climb!","7047":"\ud83d\ude00","7048":"There are benches in the shade along the way too.","7049":"If you are lucky, you can see the animals being fed!","7050":"There are Picnic areas too, it's a great plan for a day out with kids !","7051":"\ud83d\ude00","7052":"A very well organised and safe feeling family trip to the zoo.","7053":"The staff are very friendly and knowledgeable and will answer any questions you ate the little ones may have.","7054":"Loads to see and do here... there is quite a steep walk uphill if you're as unfit as I am, but the pandas are well worth the hike!","7055":"So many adorable animals and a lively setting too.","7056":"I visted 1st august 2020 , i have been at the zoo loads before but this visit was a totsl waste of time and money hardley any animals out , lots of stuff where you can view animals closed off which was no need as you could socially distance at most of them poor show needs vast improvement","7057":"Love this zoo and as a member I\u2019m a regular visitor ..","7058":"however it\u2019s far far to busy.. people clearly not stick to the guidelines..","7059":"I know this isn\u2019t all the zoo or staffs fault .. but even in the areas that staff were in control off there ..","7060":"like the line to get into see the chimps... there was no social distancing normally I\u2019m there all day ..","7061":"2 hours was my limit... the play park was over run with kids .. and adults no social distancing I really think the numbers needs to be reduced ..","7062":"I will not be returning anytime soon","7063":"My wife and I recently became members of Edinburgh Zoo, primarily to support the feeding of animals through lockdown.","7064":"Having received our membership and with lock down measures easing and the Zoo reporting good COVID-19 procedures in place...we decided to visit today.","7065":"Very pleased on arrival to find no queues, sanitising stations and helpful ticket booth staff who carefully explained the one way measures that were in place.","7066":"However, once out in the park, it was a different story.","7067":"We encountered people walking the wrong way down one way routes... typically 2, 3 and even 4 abreast!","7068":"Crowding around viewing shelters in spite of clear signs requesting one \u201ctroop\u201d at a time.","7069":"Eventually we felt in necessary to advise people contravening the rules that the signs were there, only to be subjected to a tirade of abuse.","7070":"Sadly, some people were just not being considerate of others.","7071":"Clearly it is not enough to have signs in place telling people how to conduct themselves, it is incumbent upon the Zoo team to actively police visitors...a team member at every covered viewing Area would assist as would random members of staff policing the one way system.","7072":"First visit since lockdown doubled as a first meeting in months with my sister and brother in law.","7073":"We were all very reassured by the one way system, the number of sanitising stations and, especially, the behaviour of fellow visitors.","7074":"Some areas understandably closed off but open areas were a delight - we were lucky enough to see a panda grab some bamboo then walk toward us before sitting down to munch in front of us.","7075":"Enjoying a nice G&T while wandering around made the evening that little bit more special.","7076":"The set up for the shop\/exit is ideal.","7077":"Great work, all.","7078":"We turned up just before 5:30pm and joined the back of the queue in the car park - the After Hours ticket was that popular.","7079":"However, the queue did move fairly quickly once the gates opened.","7080":"Some of the areas were closed to the public and the catering on offer was limited but it was nice to stroll around with a pint.","7081":"The monkeys were the most active, the panda looked like he\u2019d finished for the day, some of the penguins were asleep, and the tapir did a wee.","7082":"Visited before a long drive home and wasn't disappointed!","7083":"Inside was well sign posted and the one way system worked well however did create some confusion at parts.","7084":"The zoo was very clean and well looked after a very fun day out!","7085":"Maybe just add another drink stall on the other side of the zoo for drinks on that half?","7086":"It is our second time to visit the Edinburgh Zoo.","7087":"Large zoo with plenty of animals.","7088":"They implemented a one-way system due to the COVID-19 restrictions and they understandably suspended the shows.","7089":"Unlike the other reviewers, I did not get upset about it as I did not expect people will be fully compliant with it specially in an open space with children.","7090":"However, more staff members around could have been helpful.","7091":"Otherwise, we enjoyed our visit and the children had an amazing time.","7092":"They enjoyed the penguins in particular, we did too.","7093":"The tiger and pandas were quite enjoyable.","7094":"Also, the play areas were quite good specially in such a sunny day.","7095":"I am sure we will visit again soon.","7096":"Disappointing is quite an understatement .","7097":"Hardly any animals to see , long queues, lack of staff visibility , no monitoring of the one way system , terrible choice and quality of food , as well as being expensive .","7098":"Felt the main attraction was the play parks .","7099":"After what the Country has been though , if you are going to open , then do it right .","7100":"A half baked attempt but still charging full prices is just so wrong .","7101":"Was excited to finally have a family day out, but sadly our enthusiasm waned when we  discovered many areas were closed\/ several animals out of view\/and many parts of the zoo looking run down and unkempt.","7102":"We counted that we saw  50% of the animals  highlighted in the free Park map.","7103":"The place was worryingly mobbed and although  there were attempts to appeal to visitors to socially distance, there were some  areas which were simply a free-for-all.","7104":"We queued for 15 minutes to see lions but gave up on the tigers as the queue was simply too long.","7105":"The many play areas were teeming, sadly suggesting the children were more entertained by swings than livestock.","7106":"Staff were helpful and surprisingly  buoyant in this lacklustre zoo and being the best part of \u00a3100 out of pocket for the 'privilege' I'm afraid these customers were pretty sad too.","7107":"Was lovely to get out and go somewhere now that places have opened up.","7108":"The zoo was a little busy but the staff were absolutely amazing and were so helpful with any questioned we had.","7109":"The only one thing they could have done would be to label the toilets as unisex on the maps as many toilets were closed.","7110":"We did a second walk round and most of the busy attraction animals were empty so we could spend more time there.","7111":"Well done to the zoo staff for getting everything in place to allow us to enjoy an afternoon ouy again.","7112":"The atmosphere was very good with all of the visitors we were around being mindful of the guidance to maintain distance from other groups or troops as the zoo signs mentioned.","7113":"There were queues to see some of the more popular animals and  as a result we had short sightings to allow the next family in.","7114":"There was a lot of consideration for others in our experience.","7115":"The new panda habitat is a step up from what they had before.","7116":"The monkeys, gibbons and penguins all seemed to enjoy having an audience again.","7117":"The route around the zoo is well signposted and  nobody seemed to have an issue with this.","7118":"Food prices are high but right now I don't mind since the zoo has high costs and if they can make a profit on optional extras that seems like good business to me.","7119":"We will be back soon since it did feel very safe even with a lot of people around.","7120":"The staff were extremely pleasant and helpful.","7121":"Lots of measures in place for social distancing, very well thought out, however people visiting wasn't following the simple rules\/instructions, there is clear signs on all the viewing areas saying one family at a time but unfortunately most visitors didn't care and just came in while we was viewing animals, am not taking about small children am talking about full grown adults with their kids.","7122":"The only way to stop this would be to have a member of staff at each viewing area, although people should have more respect and should be able to follow very simple instructions.","7123":"Cafe.","7124":"Absolutely ridiculous the price of food and drinks.","7125":"Shame on Edinburgh Zoo for charging these ridiculous prices.","7126":"Its time the government was putting a stop to this types of places overcharging for food and drinks.","7127":"I wouldn't midn if it was a extra 0.30p but you're talking at over \u00a31.50 of a over price for juice.","7128":"\u00a31.85 for a small bottle of fruit shoot.","7129":"\u00a32.60 for a bottle of coke!","7130":"Food was disgusting, my husband had a toastie, wasn't toasted properly, was a mixture of warm and rubber tasting cheese on brick hard bread.","7131":"Nachos with cheese was like eating cardboard and rubber.","7132":"Totally over priced and disgusting.","7133":"Not blaming the staff, they don't make the prices up.","7134":"Time management was sorting this out rather than worrying about lining their pockets.","7135":"Such a shame as would've been 5 stars but due to food\/juice prices and the fact the food was disgusting I can't give a 5 star review.","7136":"Also the juice was in a fridge but was warm so fridges not even set at the right temperature.","7137":"Absolute greedy disgraceful management team.","7138":"I would leave one star but that would be unfair on the staff.","7139":"This would have been easily a 5 star review but it was let down by the cost and quality of the food.","7140":"We went a week after it reopened from lockdown.","7141":"So didn\u2019t know what to expect.","7142":"The staff were friendly and helpful.","7143":"Everything had been well thought out.","7144":"A good one way system in place.","7145":"Couldn\u2019t see everything we had hoped for as some of the inside areas had to be closed but staff explained they were hopping to get these reopened ASAP.","7146":"There was no penguin parade and this won\u2019t happen for a long time according to staff.","7147":"As they need everyone close together to stop the penguins wandering off and getting lost.","7148":"Saw the pandas, they are great a Animals","7149":"but they don\u2019t really do much.","7150":"This will most likely be the only time in that I will get to see them give how it endangered they are and that they are only on loan from the Chinese.","7151":"Because the zoo limited numbers allowed in never had to wait to long to access the viewing platforms.","7152":"Due to social distancing.","7153":"They had also brought in lots of extra toilets to help with social distancing.","7154":"Lots of hand washing and sanitising places everywhere.","7155":"Had a fanatic day, was only let down by the coat and quality of food.","7156":"I knew in advance that it would only be takeaway places available.","7157":"That was ok, I get things have changed.","7158":"But nearly \u00a35 for a poor quality sandwich and \u00a32.59 for a bottle of water was far to expensive.","7159":"Got some nachos for \u00a34.50 these were poor quality and ended up leaving most of them.","7160":"I just hope the animals get better food than this, which by the look of how someone of the monkeys were going crazy at feeding time I would say they thoroughly enjoyed their lunch.","7161":"I just wished I had brought a packed lunch.","7162":"But given that the park is on a steep hillside I wouldn\u2019t have wanted to carry round lunch for 6 people all day.","7163":"I think you can go back out to your car but currently the only entrance and exit is at the bottom of the hill and the car park is half way up the hill.","7164":"No ideal to nip back out to.","7165":"But overall a great day, the animals were amazing and the staff were great.","7166":"For me, Edinburgh zoo is one of the best in the UK!","7167":"The zoo is spacious, with the animals having large enclosures.","7168":"All of the animals look happy.","7169":"The zoo is quite steep, but there is an option to get a lift to the top of the zoo if you have accessibility issues.","7170":"The highlight of the day is most definitely the penguin parade - where the penguins go for a walk around - but they are not forced to!","7171":"Another highlight is the Giant Pandas - who have moved to a new, more spacious enclosure.","7172":"Edinburgh zoo is one of my favourite zoos to go to in the Uk as it has a range of animals unlike other zoos for example pandas, koalas, tigers, lions.","7173":"One of my favourite things about Edinburgh zoo is that they offer a penguin parade.","7174":"This is where members of the public line up around the outside of a certain area and they open the door of the penguin cage, which then allowed the penguins to come out for a walk if they wish.","7175":"This is such a unique opportunity.","7176":"Th\u00e9 pandas are absolutely amazing as well!We went to a few of the talks while we visited including the tiger one.","7177":"The man was so friendly and very informative.","7178":"There is a glass archway that you can walk under in the tiger enclosure and we were lucky enough to have the tiger literally sitting right above us!While we were there, there was only some baby lion cubs which were incredible cute and we saw them playing outside.","7179":"The zoo is a great day out!","7180":"We spent around 5 hours there and is a very reasonable price.","7181":"We will definitely be back!","7182":"Edinburgh Zoo is a great place to spend a day in Edinburgh.","7183":"There are many animals to see, and there are some great views of the city as well from the top of the hill.","7184":"However, as the zoo is built on a hill, it can be tiring to walk to all the places.","7185":"It's a well layout zoo, lots of wildlife and places to walk, but it is on a hill, and not to be too drastic, but if you are tired, you'll be drained by the end.","7186":"What may be best, and this is just an observation, not a plan of action, go directly to the pandas and zebras, that's almost the highest point of the zoo, and do the rest backwards.","7187":"(We did go all the way to the lookout, but there's nothing really there except for it and some portable toilets).On your way there, there are more animals to watch, but really, it's a walk!","7188":"Besides, we were trying to get to the panda's feeding time, and were kind of short on time to get there, maybe that's why it was such a chore.","7189":"Loved every attraction, and the animals look so happy in there enclosures.","7190":"Amazing how going in you know you're in a fairly suburban area but it feels more and more like your in the middle of nowhere as you go further in and they have so much space xx","7191":"Fabulous visitor experience.","7192":"Not just the pandas (usually asleep!)","7193":"But all the other animals on view.","7194":"Great children's play area beside the penguins.","7195":"Top tip - if you have mobility problems or kiddies in a pushchair ask for a free lift to the top.","7196":"(The zoo is on a steep hillside)","7197":"They have specially adapted cars for wheelchairs and buggies and you can see all the animals as you wander back downhill.(Grateful Papa!)","7198":"This zoo deceived me; When I first visited it I thought it was a tiny small zoo.","7199":"I first went to the Zoo for the Lantern festival I did the Lantern Festival and while I struggled with the hills I took my time and did my best.","7200":"That first visit gave me the impression that the zoo was only a small zoo that was orientated towards customer satisfaction and Animal enjoyment and safety.","7201":"Roll on 3 days later I go back to the zoo to explore the animals.","7202":"Believing the zoo to be small I didn't worry when I was running late.","7203":"When I entered the zoo to visit during the day I was given a map and off I went to explore the zoo only to find that the  zoo was 2 maybe 3 times bigger than the Lantern festival made me believe.","7204":"It gets more hilly but for day visits the Zoo also has a car ride service for those with mobility issues there is a car service that will help get you up to any specific areas you are struggling with.","7205":"The Animals all have large enclosures and are clearly happy.","7206":"The keepers care about the animals welfare and the guest welfare and are happy to help anyway they can.","7207":"On the downside thought the food was terrible and when I complained about the meal I had purchased being cold Was told","7208":"yeah","7209":"your right sorry but not offered a refund or alternative meal.","7210":"(I had ordered a hot meal)","7211":"Good range of animals.","7212":"Steep hills in areas so wear sensible shoes.","7213":"The new panda enclosure was worth the climb.","7214":"The penguin area is fab and a big hit with little ones and adults.","7215":"The baby ant eater is very cute.","7216":"The lions were good with lots of view points.","7217":"The cafe wasn\u2019t great but we visited during March 20 whilst the world was locking down.","7218":"I can imagine this is normally very busy.","7219":"There are a couple of smoking areas.","7220":"Loos are spaced out across the park.","7221":"The information is interesting.","7222":"A good beautiful zoo to visit.","7223":"Animals are clean and lively with huge variety as are the pens","7224":"so I think they are well treated which is very important.","7225":"Its a full day out for a better time.","7226":"Visited for our son\u2019s third birthday and travelled up from essex.","7227":"It was a great day out - pandas, lion cubs and a baby koala made the day.","7228":"It was a very quiet day so we enjoyed the zoo at our leisure, and there were a couple of places to eat.","7229":"It is very hilly though, so do check out accessibility of you need too!","7230":"It's clear from the outset that these animals are cared and loved for!Wish we had been able to go on a warmer\/less windy day so we could have seen more animals.","7231":"Be aware if you are pregnant\/have low mobility, the zoo is hill based but the staff at reception do offer accesabilty support","7232":"The one mile route takes in over 600 handmade lanterns with the lost worlds theme detailing life on earth from its prehistoric origins up until today.","7233":"Visually stunning, educational, and thoroughly entertaining.","7234":"It's the perfect way to spend an evening in winter.","7235":"A lovely day at the zoo.","7236":"Such great setting, lots of nice areas to sit (even though it was cold).","7237":"Amazing to see so many baby animals, three lion cubs, a baby chimp and a baby Koala.","7238":"Seeing the Pandas was amazing.","7239":"The zoo keepers were all very informative.","7240":"Lots of interactive things to see and do as well.","7241":"Gotta be prepared for a lot of uphill walkingThe animals especially the exotic ones were amazing to see, enclosures large enough to see all animals clearlyThe talks were very interesting and educational to the point we stood in a hailstorm to listenFood was very reasonable for a zoo","7242":"Fantastic Facility, great selection of animals.","7243":"Unfortunately the day we attended there was light rain and even the animals had more sense than us and remained under cover.","7244":"There were plenty eateries around the complex but again, with the time of year most were closed.","7245":"Plenty of interaction, displays and informative talks on offer at set times and if you want to make the most of your visit, please allow at least 4hrs.","7246":"The Zoo itself is set on a hillside so those of the less able might find it a little difficult although there is assistance on site with buggies etc.","7247":"Well worth the visit and kids will love it, like I said on a better day it would have for 5 stars \u2b50\ufe0f","7248":"The zoo wasn't the best zoo we have visited.","7249":"The panda's were the highlight of the trip.","7250":"We found the admission price quite steep compared to other attractions we have visited.","7251":"The zoo seemed very dated and a bit untidy.","7252":"I finally got to see in Person my life time hero of Sir Nilas and he is as majestic as legend says...","7253":"In all seriousness though - the zoo is great.","7254":"Great place to take friends and families.","7255":"The lions are a real bonus especially the young cubs.","7256":"Lovely zoo in the middle of Edinburgh, there is a lot of steep hills to climb.","7257":"we took my mum who is in a wheelchair and pushed her around.","7258":"fantastic day out for all.","7259":"Panda's and Tigers and Lions pluss lots more.","7260":"the Penguins are awesome.","7261":"Brilliant day at the zoo.","7262":"We were lucky enough to bump into Barry doing a talk and decided to tag along.","7263":"We ended up listening to them all.","7264":"Very informative and funny.","7265":"His comedic dislike for Pandas in favour of Socorro Doves was very amusing.","7266":"The zoo gets better with every visit.","7267":"Can\u2019t recommend highly enough.","7268":"Great place for young and old, not great weather but loads of places for shelter.","7269":"Our favourite were the colourful birds jumped right on our heads and shoulders as we got in the avery!","7270":"We fed them too and had a really good day out.","7271":"The panda was asleep and the tiger.","7272":"Typical for a cat though.","7273":"Chimpanzees were funny and penguins were so cute.","7274":"The penguin parade is so good they are so proud of themselves.","7275":"Nice places to eat but not cheap.","7276":"Brillant zoo.","7277":"Good value for money and great location.","7278":"The kids really enjoyed seeing the panda's .","7279":"Well worth a visit.","7280":"Plenty of walking and great attractions.","7281":"The monkey enclosure is fantastic.","7282":"Thanks.","7283":"DO NOT WASTE TIME OR","7284":"MONEY!There are so many more Zoo\u2019s that are a joyful, educational experience and also do invaluable work for conservation and animal welfare.","7285":"On paper it\u2019s a Zoo in reality it is an uphill,sparse place.","7286":"No wonder the poor Panda was sleeping.","7287":"I will never go again \ud83d\ude22","7288":"We had planned to visit the zoo during our stay in Edinburgh, sadly it is quite run down looking with many enclosures empty for renovating and most of the animals were sadly not able to be seen , perhaps a visit in the better weather would ensure being able to see more .One","7289":"highlight however was being able to feed the Lorakeets which took some of the disappointment of not seeing many animals away -","7290":"Great day out.","7291":"It was cold but it didn\u2019t spoil the day.","7292":"Saw lots of animals.","7293":"Some were inside but still managed to see them.","7294":"The penguin parade was good and the talk was informative as was the panda talk.","7295":"The keepers were knowledgable in their area of expertise.","7296":"There weren\u2019t many cafes open but it probably wasn\u2019t worth it as was quiet.","7297":"The one that was open was very nice.","7298":"Good food and friendly staff and was table service which was good.","7299":"The gift shop had a wide selection of things to buy from soft toys, books, clothes ornaments and other things.","7300":"Will definitely be back again","7301":"Visited this venue today and was not impressed.","7302":"Arrived just before opening and as expected there was a few people waiting to get including some school trips, when door opened took ages to enter as there is no group counter.","7303":"Once you get in to zoo area first thing you notice is that you need to be a mountain goat to get up hills I feel sorry for people with wheelchairs and pushchairs.","7304":"Most of enclosures were empty.","7305":"Park seems unkept as lot of cones covering holes in walkways.","7306":"Oh and main cafe was closed to visitors so that zoo staff can use it.","7307":"Me and my Mam visited here on our trip to Edinburgh.","7308":"It isn\u2019t far to travel on the bus and there is a bus stop just outside.","7309":"We pre-booked our tickets as it\u2019s 10% cheaper to book on their website (\u00a332.60 for 2 tickets).","7310":"Unfortunately these are non-refundable and we were unlucky with the weather on the day.","7311":"We spent all day there (10am-4pm) and we saw as much as we could despite the rain and snow.","7312":"The staff member doing the animal talks that day (I think his name was Barry) was really friendly, even giving us extra talks on animals that weren\u2019t on the itinerary.","7313":"My favourite part was definitely the pandas.","7314":"We could only see one eating, the other was hiding, but it was definitely the most popular animal there, it was difficult to get a space to see it.","7315":"It\u2019s also on top of a hill so it might be difficult for people with mobility issues.","7316":"I also loved the penguins which were very cute.","7317":"There were a lot of babies born as well, we saw a glimpse of the koala and chimp babies.","7318":"The gift shop had a lot on offer at a range of prices, and is open half an hour longer than the zoo.","7319":"I would recommend taking a packed lunch as the food is a bit on the expensive side.","7320":"I spent \u00a33.60 on an average hot chocolate that was barely warm.","7321":"Overall, it would be nice to revisit when some of the renovations have been completed, such as the giraffe enclosure.","7322":"We decided to give edinburugh zoo a visitWas \u00a35 for parking and was surprised that it was \u00a319 per person to get in aswell.","7323":"We were lucky we get in free with our Chester zoo passes.","7324":"The whole zoo is on a slope so if your unfit like me it's a real struggle, I think people pay what they do just to see the pandas and koalas they are clearly the focal point which is cool only thing is you cant take a clear picture of the pandas as to where they are located.","7325":"Alot of the enclosures had nothing in them which was a little disappointing however we thought thepenguin enclosure was fab!","7326":"The penguins looked so happy where they were.","7327":"Me and my partner found the chimpanzee building great so much better than chester zoo but it did smell really bad like drains though the chimps were behind glass.","7328":"We only spent about 3 hours here and we had see  the lot.","7329":"We had the most fantastic zookeeper experience yesterday afternoon during a short break in the weather.","7330":"Rosie introduced us to the penguins, chimpanzees, gibbons, meerkats, and this delightful armadillo.","7331":"If you love animals and are interested in conservation, give it a try .","7332":"We traveled from the south of England, over 400 miles because my daughter is fascinated with giant pandas, we took our 11, 14, 15 and 16 year old and all loved it.","7333":"The pandas were great, and I'm very glad we have traveled to see them.","7334":"However the whole zoo was very impressive.","7335":"Nice big detailed enclosures for all of their animals.","7336":"Informative keeper talks.","7337":"The penguin parade is incredibly cute.","7338":"They ask all guests to line up and form a human wall.","7339":"Then the gate of the penguin enclosure is opened and if any want to come out and have a little walk to the next gate they can.","7340":"It's totally up to the penguins.","7341":"I was absolutely blown away by the chimpanzee enclosure.","7342":"A massive enclosure of 4\/5 big areas, indoor and out, play, sleep, eat.","7343":"Etc all on different levels with connecting walkways and viewing points all inside a massive building.","7344":"It is clear the work at Edinburgh zoo is all about conservation and with some very good success stories.","7345":"Well worth a visit but be aware it is very hilly especially up to the pandas and tigers and lions.","7346":"Somebody with limited mobility may struggle.","7347":"There was issues with poor communication about weather closure.","7348":"Left a lot of people disappointed.","7349":"It was open the following day, which was worse weather than the day it was closed.","7350":"We got in with the tickets we bought for the day it was closed without any hassle.","7351":"The zoo itself was pretty good and the animals we saw seemed happy.","7352":"It needs a little maintenance in some places.","7353":"We enjoyed our day there despite the poor weather.","7354":"My first trip to Edinburgh zoo very disappointed not alot of animals out which i understand but even the pens where you can see them indoors were either locked or having work done lots of the stands where you can buy refreshments were shut we seen 15 different animals 5 were monkeys should have been told there was work being done and not many animals out over \u00a350 wasted","7355":"This is a lovely zoo that\u2019s good value and us really close to the centre of Edinburgh.","7356":"If going by bus don\u2019t believe the map apps the busses stop right outside the entrance, it\u2019s not a 10 min walk away.","7357":"We loved being able to see the pandas, the panda cam is great.","7358":"It was a quiet day at the zoo and at the panda feeding time it was exceptionally busy and there seemed little room to see the pandas.","7359":"The kola enclosure was great and there were plenty of places to get a good look at the bears.","7360":"There was a lot if maintenance going on at the zoo and that coupled with the cold weather meant quite a few of the animals weren\u2019t around to view.","7361":"Food and drink was ok priced for a venue like this but all 3 open places were right next to each other.","7362":"It would be far better to spread out the refreshment buildings.","7363":"The walk up the hill is very steep and being able to get a drink at the top would have been much better.","7364":"Was absolutely freezing wet day","7365":"but we still had a fab day out- mainly thanks to the size of the zoo (accessible and animals close together) and the friendliness of the staff.","7366":"We were a family of 6- two teens and a 10 and 7 year old.","7367":"We saw loads of cute animals- lots of tiger action and the pandas are so cool.","7368":"Could have done with a mic for the talks but still was great.","7369":"The penguins did not want to march but that\u2019s fair enough-","7370":"what a cute idea!The biggest plus goes to the Grasslands cafe.","7371":"What a great cafe!!","7372":"It was packed-","7373":"but the staff were courteous and friendly.","7374":"It\u2019s waitress service which I love as with a family it\u2019s refreshing to have food brought to your table!","7375":"The food was delicious- soup was amazing.","7376":"This helped as we were all soaked and cold.","7377":"Thankyou for the thought that has gone into the cafe.","7378":"The highlight did the kids was the keeper in the bird area who gave them food to feed the birds.","7379":"The birds landed all over them and they loved this!","7380":"The keeper was really lovely and the teens could have stayed here fir hours.","7381":"A great experience- we caught the bus from Edinburgh city and was very easy.","7382":"If anyone has read up on the zoo I really can\u2019t see how this can\u2019t be a 5 star.","7383":"\u00a34 for 6 hours parking in Edinburgh is amazing.","7384":"We booked a holiday in Edinburgh to see the Panda\u2019s and anything else was a bonus.","7385":"The lines to get in aren\u2019t bad, staff friendly, food isn\u2019t too over priced, just a shame there\u2019s not much seating area in the cafe\u2019s for a rainy day.","7386":"Went for food at the busiest time, bit of waiting but it is what it is when everyone wants to eat at the same time.","7387":"It was a cold and rainy day and it seemed like the animals were mostly on strike, but it\u2019s good to see they have the freedom to stay in their shelters and do as they wish.","7388":"The shelters all have windows so you never miss out seeing them.","7389":"We saw them mostly sleeping but if the animals want to sleep they sleep.","7390":"Devastated I couldn\u2019t find the Scottish Wildcats in the enclosure, only one we missed.","7391":"Some have walkthroughs which I imagine are amazing in nicer weather, all are mapped out well.","7392":"We really enjoyed the day.","7393":"Whilst venturing around Edinburgh we decided to visit Edinburgh Zoo mainly because of the positive reviews on Trip Advisor and also because its home to the two Giant Pandas on loan from China.","7394":"For reference they both go home next year after the 10 year loan agreement comes to an end.","7395":"The visit was just average for many reasons, the car parking is \u00a34.00 for your vehicle, the zoo opens 10.am - 4.pm everyday but these times may possibly be extended during summer months.","7396":"The prices range from \u00a317.95 for adults and \u00a39.00 for children under 15, children under 3 get in free of charge and concessions are \u00a315.50 which covers students, blue badge holders, unemployed and over 60's.","7397":"These prices are all online prices if you book your ticket 24 hours prior to entering the zoo.","7398":"My gripe at this zoo and many others for that matter is that whilst zoo's are a great environment for the protection and conservation of animals and to prevent their extinction its just not ideal for allowing enough viewing space for the public to take photographs.","7399":"The viewing platforms are not ideal for the vast amount of visitors it receives, I understand by allowing more viewing platforms then obviously the animals would have much less space to move around their enclosures so that in comparison would be so much worse, sadly its just an annoying gripe I have with zoo's in general.","7400":"When we arrived on a cold and wet February morning the place was extremely busy with people queuing at the entrance and this was just before  10.00 am.","7401":"This in itself has definitely put me off visiting this zoo in the Summer months as if my visit is anything to go especially by just on the abundance  of people waiting to see the animals its just frustrating.","7402":"In conclusion least we got to see the Giant Pandas.","7403":"# \ud83d\udc3c","7404":"We visited the zoo over our valentines weekend getaway.","7405":"We are members of another zoo and were able to use our passes to gain entry.","7406":"While the zoo isn\u2019t anything special, the weather was extremely bad so the zoo had to shut early and not many animals were out but we enjoyed our visit especially getting to see the koala bears, giant pandas and the different variety of penguins.","7407":"The food in the Grasslands restaurant is fantastic, and very reasonably priced for a zoo.","7408":"Would recommend a visit if in Edinburgh.","7409":"Edinburgh Zoo isn't really anything special but it's always a good day out.","7410":"There are loads of interesting animals.","7411":"Some, like Koalas and Giant Pandas that you rarely find in UK zoos.","7412":"When we went recently there were a lot of empty enclosures and it's not a very buggy friendly zoo, with it being built on a very steep hill.","7413":"Still, the views are beautiful and they've clearly thought about animal welfare when it comes to enclosure design.","7414":"It's not a zoo that summons up a wow factor, but it's a good couple of hours if you fancy it.","7415":"I travelled her from Liverpool, I admit I was expecting to be disappointed.","7416":"All that way for a tiny zoo.","7417":"How wrong was I it more than exceeded my expectations.","7418":"The staff were very friendly.","7419":"The zoo is clean well managed the Animals look happy.","7420":"I am a member of Chester zoo for over 8 years.","7421":"I have been to other zoos with small pens for the animals.","7422":"But this zoo is definitely in Chester zoo league.","7423":"Yes there is a lot of hills I took my son in his wheelchair.","7424":"They have a transit van you can ring to get help getting round the Zoo I never took this option but it was a great addition the zoo offer.","7425":"The staff are very helpful.","7426":"Also you get to see some great hard to see animals.","7427":"Panda\u2019s Koala plus hippo\u2019s I will return he again","7428":"but I will do a full weekend and go to the Highlands wild life park as they have polar bears.","7429":"We went on February 15th 2020 and unfortunately due to storm Dennis, they were closing the zoo at 2 and we arrived at 1 so we only got an hour but the kids loved it, especially the penguins.","7430":"I can\u2019t comment on the cafes as we obviously didn\u2019t have time to see the whole park and eat.","7431":"We definitely didn\u2019t pick the best time to go.","7432":"We paid \u00a348 online for two adult tickets and two child tickets as we had my little cousins with us and I don\u2019t feel cheated out of money at all and I only spent 1 hour there, which was nobody\u2019s fault except mother nature\u2019s.","7433":"I will definitely take the kids back again in the summer.","7434":"For me the entry price was brilliant, the animals were entertaining (or at least the ones who braved the cold anyway) and the kids enjoyed it which is the main thing.","7435":"It was my first visit aswell (although my husband had been before)","7436":"and I honestly can\u2019t wait to go back again.","7437":"Well, really dont know what others are complaining about!We visited yesterday and saw all kinds of weather: glorious sunshine, rain, heavy snow.","7438":"Even though many animals were indoors, we still saw everything.","7439":"They have various feed times advertised throughout the day, so we watched the pandas get a feed and heard the keeper talk.","7440":"The enclosures are all enormous and provide plenty of space for the animals.","7441":"We were very lucky and saw the koala joey, plus the lions and their cubs had Valentines enrichment, so we stumbled upon them and watched for around half an hour, fantastic!I absolutely loved seeing the King penguins in particular, and hearing about Brigadere Sir Nils Olaf III.","7442":"I later read up on him and realised I'd heard the story, so was glad to have seen him!It's a bit hilly in places, but not too bad.","7443":"Plenty of options to see the animals in their indoor enclosures, which a lot of zoos don't have.","7444":"All the staff we encountered were great, really friendly and informative.","7445":"I definitely recommend the talks, particularly the chimps, as we had no idea of their back story!","7446":"Very expensive if you're coming in late.","7447":"They will let you in and charge a full price even though you probably wont see much.","7448":"really good experience.","7449":"very very hilly if you want to see the pandas or zebras!","7450":"my daughter is 7 and had a great day.","7451":"food in the cafe is very expensive.","7452":"We took the little ones here for the Chinese lanterns.","7453":"It was really good, just about long enough for the 3 year old to walk around.","7454":"We enjoyed it definitely worth a try.","7455":"Look forward to a different theme next year.","7456":"I would say it is a tad expensive for the tickets if no offers found.","7457":"The zoo is amazing place, holly but well worth the visit!","7458":"The animals are kept in great conditions and the elusive panda came out as well which made my dads day as we were visiting as part of his 70th birthday celebration weekend!","7459":"this is one of those places that makes you wonder,,,what is this about?","7460":"small cramped and of little or no comfort to these imprisoned creatures makes for a sad and questionable experience.","7461":"avoid.","7462":"enough said","7463":"My partner and I visited Edinburgh Zoo on 6th February for the Penguin Experience.","7464":"It was a beautiful day, which definitely helped but the zoo was reasonably compact so it wouldn't have been too bad had it rained.","7465":"It was a little difficult to find, as the signage wasn't until the actually entry.","7466":"The zoo was really well maintained, and the workers were all very knowledgeable and happy to answer any questions.","7467":"We took part in the Penguin Experience, which was a little extra money but very much worth it as my partner is absolutely mad about penguins.","7468":"We both got to feed them, take part in the parade walk and generally get up-close with the penguins.","7469":"It was a fantastic day, and we will definitely come back one day.","7470":"We travelled from Newcastle to the zoo today as my son is obsessed with Pandas.","7471":"For me and my son it was a few pence under \u00a330.","7472":"When you entered the zoo nearly all if not all the cafes were closed(i didnt see any open other than the one where you can sit if you brought your own food).","7473":"We were informed that due to the winds they would be shutting an hour early.","7474":"Although there was no reduction in price.","7475":"Full price for an hour less and with no cafes!The staff were pleasant enough but the zoo had the feel of a place that was shutting down at any time.","7476":"Ive been before and enjoyed it.","7477":"Today however i didnt.","7478":"Maybe the winds didnt help but the fact everywhere was shut gave it the feel of a place that were happy to take your money with zero effort to make the experience worthwhile.","7479":"Lovely trip and easily accessible even from the city centre.","7480":"Reassuringly hilly by city Zoo standards.","7481":"Nice range of animals and lovely staff.","7482":"Pandas obviously.","7483":"No herons.","7484":"Expensive for what there actually is, really disappointed!","7485":"Animals homes really rundown and filfty!","7486":"The only good thing was the penguins... Don't waste your time guys","7487":"Was a really memorable experience visiting Edinburgh zoo for my birthday with my partner.","7488":"We travelled all the way from Huddersfield to see this zoo.","7489":"There was lots of animals to see and lots of talks to attend to (including the penguin parade, which was really entertaining and exciting!).Staff were friendly and approachable, and a massive shout out to Barry (member of staff) who was really welcoming on arrival and did most of the talks we attended.","7490":"He well and truly deserves a shout out because he was just so generally friendly and made the whole experience really fun and interesting.","7491":"He has a really good sense of humour and lots of interesting knowledge to tell, even going out of his way to tell guests useful information about the animals and where to go next!Thank you Barry for making the day so enjoyable!","7492":"You were amazing.","7493":"Would definitely recommend as a day out, excited to see the Giraffes that will be there soon.","7494":"Will definitely be returning!Although some of the facilities was closed around the park (probably due to it being February and a weekday), but regardless of this, the food provided from the main restaurant was tasty, filling, fast service, friendly staff and importantly had a variety of options to choose from with child friendly activities to choose from.","7495":"Another thing that I really enjoyed about the experience was how looked after the animals looked and you can really tell the staff know the animals well and really care for them.","7496":"It\u2019s inspired me to want to donate and help!","7497":"I have been to many zoo's and this one was clean, the animals looked well looked after and the enclosures were large and spacious.","7498":"Went to the panda talk and both keepers were very knowledgeable and helpful.","7499":"Take some good shoes with you though as some of the hills are steep!","7500":"Went to see the Giant lanterns hosted in Edinburgh zoo and I must say it was absolutely fantastic!","7501":"Enjoyed every bit of it.","7502":"We had a newborn with us and they made it all pram friendly with lots to see.","7503":"The whole experience was just great!","7504":"Parking fee was \u00a32 and the timings were 5-9pm.","7505":"Takes roughly an hour to walk through.","7506":"We stopped for a coffee towards the end.","7507":"Very entertaining for children and adults alike.","7508":"Would go back again next year!","7509":"\u2764\ufe0f","7510":"Lovely zoo with a good variety of animals in spacious enclosures.","7511":"Made even more pleasant by the fact that it was quiet at this time of year.","7512":"The walk throughs were good and there was a lot of information.","7513":"We visited the zoo specifically to see the pandas and we were lucky enough to see oneThe zoo is lovely, but all uphill.","7514":"The staff offered assistance upon entry if we required it.","7515":"We were happy to walk but note it would be difficult if you had a buggy or someone elderly with you.","7516":"The zoo is small but we enjoyed our morning","7517":"Myself and my Girlfriend visited the zoo whilst in Edinburgh for the weekend, from the outside I was unsure but I must say once we got \u00ecn and saw how massive the zoo was and the amount of animals there was.","7518":"We was quite lucky on the day the weather stayed dry and the majority of the animals were out including the panda and loads of penguins.","7519":"My only minor criticism would be perhaps more toilets are needed dotted around and we was unaware the chimp enclosure shut at 3.30 as we missed out on seeing them unfortunately but I must say them two minor issues aside a fantastic day out the animals are clearly looked after.","7520":"Absolutely loved this place especially the penguins and the view from the top.","7521":"The lion cubs were adorable although the lion looked distressed by pacing.","7522":"Refreshments are quite expensive but unfortunately seems to be the norm at these types of places.","7523":"A lovely day our and certainly plenty to see.","7524":"Would love to go again","7525":"We happily attended our friends wedding at the zoo and it was spectacular!As bizarre as it was walking around the zoo in black tie amongst the tourists in their casual wear, once the gates are closed and the mansion house lit ready to party it really does transform into a spectacular venue.","7526":"We didn't pay entrance as we were attending the wedding","7527":"so I can't comment on value for money or entrance fees.","7528":"We will say that the food was excellent, the staff helpful and the mansion house is beautiful.","7529":"The venue is open to the public during weddings but the hedge around the mansion offers some privacy from those enjoying seeing the animals.","7530":"We have excellent memories of the day, we were lucky to see pandas in real life and got to take part in the daily penguin walk.","7531":"A thoroughly unforgettable day!","7532":"My only regret is not seeing the penguin parade.","7533":"This is the best zoo I have ever been to, much better than London.","7534":"The pandas were the highlight and also the koalas.","7535":"There was a lot of uphill walking.","7536":"Reasonably priced gift shop and staff who really care about the animals.","7537":"I can\u2019t believe I\u2019ve seen my precious pandas at last!","7538":"The giant pandas were of course a highlight, as well as the Sumatran tiger, the lions and their cubs, and the koalas!","7539":"Interactive talks which include holding reptiles were very cool, and feeding the birds was a fun experience.","7540":"Very educational and informative, as well as interesting.","7541":"I would like to commend Carol in particular for helping us with our booking - she was amazing and very helpful!","7542":"We travelled 4 hours to get here and we were so disspointed.","7543":"Upon arrival we were shown into a scruffy car park full of pot holes under a hotel?","7544":"We were charged \u00a34 to park here.","7545":"Once we went into the reception we went to the fast track line as we had bought the tickets online.","7546":"This was a laugh, the other line got seen to before we did that were buying on the day so dont be fooled.","7547":"The guy that showed us in was informative on where to go next and what shows were on which was great.","7548":"The zoo itself was really big!","7549":"I bet its fabulous in the summer, however, in the winter we were not at all impressed.","7550":"We only got to see a few animals as most of the animals 'homes' were empty.","7551":"On the signs it said it might be too cold outside so to check in the indoor rooms for them, yet still there was nothing to be seen.","7552":"The most we seen were the big false plastic animals.","7553":"We took the pushchair and the whole zoo is up the steepest hill you could imagine.","7554":"I dont know how disabled people would manage as we really struggled pushing a baby up it.","7555":"We only spent around an hour here then went back home as it seemed a waste of time.","7556":"The zoo should definitely offer discounted prices in the winter as it was way too expensive for what you get to see and do!","7557":"took my nephews here to see some pandas because why not and they spent the whole day looking at penguins instead, not going to complain about that though!","7558":"\u00a340 for two adults last entry 3pm\u00a34 for the parking which is open all nightArrived at the reception desk was very informative proving a map with hand written key points such as must see events and animal closing times.","7559":"We arrived at 2pm on Monday of this week.","7560":"The park was pretty quiet which meant we didn\u2019t have any issues checking out the animals.","7561":"We seen the panda feeding time at 3pm but the viewing window is rather small so you have to deal with rude people standing in your way but not everyone can be polite or respectful.","7562":"The animals were very interesting and for someone who has never been to a zoo, I found it extraordinary the zoo kept animals for all types of climates.","7563":"Many of the animals were impressive and all well kept from what I seen.","7564":"They could be doing with more litter bins.","7565":"Penguin cafe was reasonably priced and stocked lactose free milk.","7566":"Two coffee and a cake \u00a38.40Not that it\u2019s been ticked off the list I wouldn\u2019t be back but enjoyed the experience and the zoo was quiet which meant it was easy to move around and excess routes without mounds of people","7567":"It\u2019s a very nice zoo with great activities and informative yet funny animal-talks.","7568":"The animals look healthy and happy.","7569":"It\u2019s too bad that they don\u2019t have that many restaurants options, so they do get very crowded and very messy.","7570":"We grabbed coffee, a blueberry muffin and a caramel shortcake at the penguin cafe which honestly was awfully dry and boring.","7571":"The toilets are also very dirty and not well maintained.","7572":"It would be great if the maps were a bit easier to read, we had some problems knowing how to find some animals and left the zoo without finding the binturongs.","7573":"If they fixed some of these things the zoo would without a doubt be a 5\/5.","7574":"Chinese Lanterns what a let down.","7575":"Very expensive for what you get.","7576":"\u00a360 entry for family of four then nearly \u00a340 for four burgers and chips.","7577":"Didn\u2019t even get to see one animal, very disappointing.","7578":"Went here today, and not very Impressed at all, the place needs a god tidy up, some of the buildings looked terrible, chimpanzee looked bored in their gloomy home, tiger was was pacing around by the fence looked really bored.","7579":"Our local zoo Marwell in Hampshire is head and tails above this, defiantly a disappointing couple of hours, apart from the Penguins good effort.","7580":"Edinburgh zoo is a great day out and not to be missed.","7581":"I wish we had had more time to enjoy it!","7582":"You need at least 3hrs if not longer to fully appreciate the whole experience.","7583":"The giant pandas are a must see as are the lions and tigers.","7584":"The only downside is it's on a HUGE hill so make sure you wear your walking boots!","7585":"Had a super day out at Edinburugh Zoo recently.","7586":"We attended the first morning talk about the Meercats and were thoroughly entertained by the very knowledgable keeper...so much so we continued to follow him around to every morning and afternoon talk.","7587":"His name was Barry - he was great!!","7588":"We have visited many zoos and this was definitely our best zoo experience so far - we learnt so much!We did meet a few other keepers and members of staff on our visit - all were friendly and polite.","7589":"The restaurant had good and speedy service.","7590":"Limited food options but prehaps there was more option in the penguin cafe which we did not visit?All in all would definitely recommend.","7591":"Having lived in Edinburgh for 5 years and never seeing the 'Giant Lanterns' at the zoo I was left very disappointing.","7592":"The interaction between the setup is poor.","7593":"The paths aren't exactly clear and the story is just plain and lifeless.","7594":"Even the giant volcano in the centre wasn't impressive as it could have been with very little effect until we began walking away... even then just a tiny puff of smoke.","7595":"It wasn't an improvement on the Zoo.","7596":"The Zoo it'self has gotten better but this attraction is solely aimed at taking your money and giving you nothing back in return.","7597":"I'd avoid it.","7598":"It was also understaffed and the toilets are disgusting see my images...I paid for 4 Full price Adults and I was left with a highly disappointing visit.","7599":"I definately wont be returning to this event again.","7600":"Nor bringing or recommending the event.","7601":"It was my second visit to the zoo but my families first.","7602":"We went back in the evening to view the lanterns and they were spectacular.","7603":"There are so many and fantastic lit up at night around the zoo.","7604":"The only thing I found slightly disappointing was the Panda visit.","7605":"On my first visit I had to book a slot and met the keeper with a group of visitors.","7606":"Both pandas were inside on their raised areas eating.","7607":"The visitor area was inside and wherever you stood the pandas were in full view.","7608":"The talk was very interesting and the whole thing a highlight of my visit to Edinburgh.","7609":"This time we found the Pandas have a new enclosure.","7610":"One of the Pandas was inside and on his raised area.","7611":"The sun was on the glass and there was only one spot that you could see in through the glass and even then you had to put your hand above your eyes to stop the glare.","7612":"Everyone had to take it in time to have a peek.","7613":"The other panda was outside and we were able to see her walking around from a reasonably close view.","7614":"In spite of the fact that I had emailed twice to check if booking in advance was required, or if any particular time was better than to visit, I was not told about the Panda talk or that there was no longer visit slots.","7615":"I also called the day before to check again and nothing was mentioned.","7616":"We arrived to find we had missed the panda talk and the person on the till just said 'well unless you are really interested in hearing about pandas you haven't missed much!'.","7617":"Please remember that these are the only Panda's in our country and I see it as a privilege to be able to fly to Edinburgh to see them.","7618":"However it is not something we can do very often as we live at the opposite end of the country!Other than that the animals look well cared for and their enclosures seem appropriate.","7619":"So myself and my boyfriend went to see the panda.","7620":"I wish we\u2019d of got there earlier as it was packed.","7621":"We did manage to get some shots and video clips though :)","7622":"The zoo as a whole is excellent and the tour guide, who is free, is very knowledgable and speaks very clearly.","7623":"I personally didn\u2019t like the monkey enclosure","7624":"but I\u2019m against monkeys\/ gorillas being kept in zoo\u2019s as a whole.","7625":"There was no were to grab a coffee which surprised me.","7626":"The parking charge was reasonable, can\u2019t remember exactly how much it was now hahaha!","7627":"\u00a34 rings a bell.","7628":"We went in the winter, it was cold and light showers weather, but we were still there for hours.","7629":"I would definitely recommend and would definitely go back there.","7630":"This was more than I expected the lay out was excellent.","7631":"And having alotted start time ment there was no over crowding.","7632":"Busy but plenty of room to walk round and enjoy the lantern experience.","7633":"Both my grandsons (7+2) had a ball.","7634":"Lots of dinosaurs for them.","7635":"Well worth a visit.","7636":"Advanced booking prices where \u00a319.67 for adults child \u00a310.66 and age 3 and under free.","7637":"I have added some photos of our experience.","7638":"It took about an hour and a half to walk round.","7639":"Parking was \u00a32 at the back of the Holiday inn hotel.","7640":"So go on get up there before it closes for this year","7641":"We originally booked the adults only night on Friday 10th Jan, got an email the day before to say it had been cancelled due to high winds which couldn't be helped and got a selection of other dates to choose from.","7642":"However, no adult only events which we were disappointed by.","7643":"We chose Saturday 11th 7pm.","7644":"The lanterns are so well made and displayed beautifully around the zoo.","7645":"We were taken aback how huge some of them were.","7646":"So worth seeing them in real life.","7647":"Reason for 1 star review is the overall experience.","7648":"Screaming kids, toddlers running around bored, prams in the way.","7649":"The whole reason we chose adults only.","7650":"They should have had another adults only option for people who booked this specifically to avoid all of the above.","7651":"Wish we asked for a refund instead of booking another date but we didn't want to miss out and had been looking forward to it for months.","7652":"It would have been a lovely peaceful dark night wandering around taking it all in but unfortunately it was ruined by all the noise and commotion.","7653":"I was also under the impression there would be street food, food trucks selling fresh food and hot drinks etc.","7654":"Maybe I read it wrong","7655":"but we stopped at one of the little cafes for a hot chocolate which was lovely.","7656":"The cakes and muffins however were disgusting and really shouldn't be for sale in that condition.","7657":"All look lovely behind the glass but clearly been sitting there for days.","7658":"Completely inedible.","7659":"We spent around 40 minutes there in total.","7660":"Including the parking we paid \u00a342 in total which was a very expensive night out.","7661":"If you are going as a couple or group of adults and want to make the most of it and have an enjoyable experience then I'd suggest booking the adults only night for next year.","7662":"We will book it for next year and if it was to be cancelled again due to weather we would ask for a refund.","7663":"Brilliant zoo to visit, so many animals and we were there for about 2 hours in total so well worth the money.","7664":"It was great to see so many animals with plenty of space in large enclosures.","7665":"The only disappointment we had was with the pandas.","7666":"The girl at the ticket desk told us all about them and said they were not to be missed but when we go to their enclosure they were nowhere to be seen.","7667":"Looked in their house and outside area and nothing.","7668":"Decided to book the Groupon deal for the Giant Lanterns during the Christmas holidays.","7669":"Booked for the 5.30pm entry time and we sat in a queue of traffic (for the event) for about 20 mins so were a wee bit late.","7670":"\u00a32 charge for the car park.","7671":"Groupon ticket holders were called to the front so we seemed to get in a bit quicker which was a bonus.","7672":"The giant lanterns were beautiful!","7673":"We really thought we'd be round and out in about 30 minutes but it took us about an hour and a half, taking our time.","7674":"Would highly recommend!As far as food is concerned, this was awful.","7675":"We didn't eat before we went as we'd seen that there was food available - burgers, hot dogs etc at \u00a36.00 each.","7676":"The price made us assume that these were gourmet - like street food truck burgers.","7677":"However, they were pre made and kept in bags in the cafe area of the zoo - absolutely disgusting hot dog which you could hardly bite into and the burgers were dry and tasted like dog food.","7678":"We ask for fresh ones which were just as bad and eventually asked for our money back.","7679":"There were a few people complaining of the same!Perhaps in the future they should have street food trucks selling good quality food instead.","7680":"The marshmallow toasting was a great idea though - we really enjoyed it!","7681":"This zoo was lovely to visit and see how much they really care about the animals and conservation.","7682":"Staff were friendly and chatty throughout ..","7683":"Be warned though, the zoo is very hilly.","7684":"A great day out to be had however!","7685":"Me and my sister visited the zoo for the day on New Year\u2019s Eve with a 3 year old and 8 year old.","7686":"Me and my son was staying in Edinburgh for new year as my sister lives there.","7687":"I can honestly say this is the best zoo I have ever been to!","7688":"I have visited many zoos but found this one by far the very best.","7689":"There is so many exotic animals and the first thing we saw were the red pandas!","7690":"It\u2019s also great value for money as you have the whole day there.","7691":"We stayed all day and had lunch in a nice cafe with very nice food and hot choc!","7692":"We got to see the giant panda,lions,monkeys,flamingos,tigers the list goes on and on it\u2019s just such an amazing place and a must if your in Edinburgh!","7693":"We took the bus and the zoo was so interesting.","7694":"Many different venues and the penguins were hilarious.","7695":"It is one of the nicest zoos I have ever visited.","7696":"Everything was clean and tidy, paths are well-signed.","7697":"The garden is spacious so even with a lot of tourists inside you have some decent space for yourself.","7698":"There are a lot of species here, from all over the world.","7699":"I think it was the first time for me to see red pandas!","7700":"You need to go to see penguins' parade - something amazing!","7701":"So spontaneus and cheerful, great fun to see.","7702":"We spent here a couple of hours, there are so many wonderful animals to observe.","7703":"We visited as a family of grandparents, parents and children to see the lanterns .","7704":"We had a fab time, even better than last year too.","7705":"We were lucky to have a dry evening which made it perfect to see all the exhibits.","7706":"Such a clever show,  it would be great if somewhere it explains how the lanterns are constructed.","7707":"First time at Edinburgh Zoo.","7708":"Really enjoyable","7709":"but when they say it\u2019s built on a hill they mean it!!!Lion cubs amazing, pandas pretty active and the red pandas were doing lots of climbing.","7710":"Cracking zoo with some really nice enclosures where you could get really close to the animals!","7711":"So we went on a 9 hour drive to come to this zoo..","7712":"Mainly for me to tick seeing a panda off my bucket list!Pros.","7713":"They have a Panda - although view of the panda is not greatParking was only a poundZoo entry is not expensiveClean zoo with impressive shop entranceConsWhole zoo is uphill - not exaggerating!","7714":"If you are disabled or have difficulty walking, don't bother!Price of food and drinks is robbery!","7715":"Bring a lunch!Animals appeared run down and fed up (esp the Gorrilas - so sad that I decided to leave not long after being there)Cages appear too small for certain animals and nothing like their own habitat which is cruelI think this zoo is a fair price for entry\/parking and of course they have the panda, but to be honest, I think it should really be looked at for a refurbishment or ultimately closed down for the sake of the animals.","7716":"Other zoos such as Colchester accommodate for their animals a lot better than this zoo.","7717":"The fact the whole zoo is up hill is strenuous and not well thought out.","7718":"We spent a chilly but dry Monday at the Zoo and it was a day well spent.","7719":"Loads of great enclosures and beautiful animals and we had the added bonus of seeing the lion cubs that had recently been born.","7720":"Very reasonably priced and a lot of good work being done to help the long term survival of numerous species.","7721":"Red pandas are just gorgeous and on such a quiet day were happy to wander around their tree and not shy away.","7722":"There are lovely views at this zoo as it is set in a hilly area.","7723":"So be aware that there is a bit of walking up and down slopes to see the animals.","7724":"The pandas have been moved to a new enclosure at the top of the zoo, so be prepared to walk uphill to get there.","7725":"They are well worth the walk though.","7726":"We saw most animals on our visit.","7727":"There are some absolutely gorgeous baby lions to be seen playing with one another.","7728":"There are many enclosures under cover, so if it is raining, there are plenty of places to shelter.","7729":"Enjoy your visit.","7730":"Our boys aged 11 and 15 took lots of photos so definitely enjoyed themselves.","7731":"Went for the giant lanterns and it was absolutely amazing!","7732":"It took us over an hour and we enjoyed every minute.","7733":"Just beautiful photo opportunities as we went round.","7734":"The lanterns are incredible!\u2019","7735":"We were sadly disappointed by our visit to the zoo today.","7736":"Animals were spread out over a large area with long uphill walks between exhibits.","7737":"We saw more animal models than actual animals.","7738":"Many of the exhibits were surrounded by overgrown vegetation so you couldn\u2019t actually see the animals at all!We visited the penguin parlour in the morning for coffee, some of our group were disappointed by their dry cookies.","7739":"Coffee was nice.","7740":"Penguin parkour assured us there were gluten free menu options in the main restaurant so at lunch time we waited through a long queue to be seated only to find sparse gluten free options on the menu!","7741":"Extortionate prices and lack of choice on menu!Heard a few zoo talks from one of the keepers.","7742":"I think name James?","7743":"Extremely friendly and professional keeper.","7744":"Really enjoyed his talks, as well as a snippet of information he gave our group in passing about red pandas!Pictures show the some of the few animals I actually saw whilst there.","7745":"Penguin exhibit was excellent.","7746":"Have been to Edinburgh zoo a few times and I wouldn\u2019t say I like it very much.","7747":"It\u2019s expensive","7748":"and I always feel that we don\u2019t see many animals there.","7749":"However this time was really good.","7750":"It was rainy day","7751":"but we have seen lots of animals.","7752":"You can hide from rain in one of exhibitions under the roof.","7753":"Map that you get is really handy.","7754":"Looks like children play areas all updated.","7755":"Little parrots and meeting the reptiles is very exciting for children too.","7756":"Definitely the biggest and best zoo I\u2019ve ever been to.","7757":"Shame we didn\u2019t get to see the panda feed due to popularity of the event.","7758":"However, the zoo did not disappointed.","7759":"The penguins were my favourite and it was brilliant to see the penguins being fed, even if they didn\u2019t want to make an appearance for the parade.","7760":"Staff were very helpful and willing to answer any questions we had.","7761":"Would definitely recommend.","7762":"A fantastic display again this year, informative and colourful.","7763":"Loved the clocks at the beginning and the end.","7764":"Only downside was the cost.","7765":"We saw so many interesting and beautiful animals on our visit.","7766":"It was a very cold and wet day so a lot of the animals were hiding from view, hence 4 instead of 5 stars, but we moved our trip all the same.","7767":"The giant pandas are a sight to behold.","7768":"The rhinos are amazing creatures.","7769":"So happy the penguin parade is still in operation despite not being advertised on the zoo website.","7770":"Unfortunately none of the penguins wanted to parade when we were there but we moved watching them being fed and swimming and diving.","7771":"The zoo keepers were very knowledgeable and keen on conservation..","7772":"They were also raising awareness of the impact of non-sustainable palm oil which was great to hear.","7773":"All in all a great day and easy trip from town via bus.","7774":"Thank you.","7775":"Writing a review here as I can't see a separate entry for the Dinosaur Lantern Show.","7776":"Entrance is expensive but it is a sight to behold.","7777":"Absolutely amazing, so many dinosaurs along with amazing flowers too. .","7778":"Very impressed at the size of some of the displays and the colours were truly amazing.","7779":"Fab for both kids and adults.","7780":"You can stop off for a warm drink en route as it can be cold here.","7781":"Worth noting that you need to walk up steep hills so not so good for folks who can't walk too far.","7782":"We pre-booked the lanterns and then used the discount to visit the zoo during the day.","7783":"My biggest tip - get there when it opens at 10am, you really do need all day to see whole zoo and even then you'll struggle.","7784":"We joined some of the talks which are definitely worth it, very interesting and you'll learn a lot from them.","7785":"The work the zoo has done with endangered species, especially ones you may have never heard of, is incredible.","7786":"The hands-on reptile talk allows you to handle a few select animals and is popular with the children.","7787":"We opted to eat in the Grasslands Restaurant and, despite being in a party of 16 people, there was plenty of space to sit together.","7788":"The food wasn't too overly priced and for the most part was good quality.","7789":"The gift shop is well stocked and has a great range to suit all budgets.","7790":"The dinosaur-themed lantern show in the evening was exceptional and we'll definitely consider returning next year.","7791":"The lanterns are all hand-painted in China.","7792":"This was a festive treat for our grandchildren, big scary dinosaurs all brilliantly lit up bringing a totally different front to the zoo and obviously generating extra cash at a quieter time of year.","7793":"Enjoyed the theme but what really stuck in the throat was the charge made for the food which was sub standard.","7794":"Let\u2019s face it, a scrawny burger slapped in a roll, no extras, chips that were undercooked and a bottle of sprite to wash it down.....\u00a310.65.","7795":"All that was missing was the stripped jersey and mask.","7796":"Poor show Zoo people.","7797":"My boyfriend and I full enjoyed our day out to Edinburgh Zoo.","7798":"Plenty of animals and they all had loads of room which was great.","7799":"The setting is set on a hill and you can see amazing views at the top.","7800":"Plenty of facilities around too.","7801":"Very easy to get to, day riders are \u00a34.00 which is a great price.","7802":"My girlfriend and I spent the day at Edinburgh zoo and couldn't have been happier with our experience.","7803":"All the animals were out and about and we got to see everything we wanted.","7804":"James the animal talk presenter for the day was brilliant and clearly very passionate about all the animals.","7805":"Day was highlighted by a random guy at the pelicans shouting to his girlfriend, \"there like turkeys but with wings!\"","7806":"I don't know what turkeys this guy had seen before but it was funny.","7807":"An impressive variety of animals, and we were lucky enough to catch most of them out and about.","7808":"The animal talks were very informative, led by James on the day of our visit (who was brilliant, along with the other staff we met and spoke to), and added to the experience.","7809":"Despite the panda feed and talk being (not unexpectedly) packed, we managed to get a good view of Yang Guang whilst he was feeding (at least briefly), and then Tian Tian in her inside enclosure too.","7810":"We were told about conservation work outside of the zoo too which was encouraging.","7811":"Killer hills to access the back of the zoo but we were fully informed of this at the entrance!","7812":"A lovely day out.","7813":"Went to Lanterns, not worth bothering with.","7814":"First year was FANTASTIC, second year (last year) was good this year not worth it.","7815":"Too 'samy' all the dinosaurs similar colour and apperance.","7816":"Bring back the chinese theme of year 1.","7817":"We decided to visit the zoo and pay as we entered rather than on-line just in case it rained on the day.","7818":"The walk up prices are Adult \u00a319.95, Child (3-15) \u00a39.95, Child (Under 3) Free, Concession \u00a317.50.","7819":"The discounted online prices are Adult \u00a317.95, Child (3-15) \u00a39.00, Child (Under 3) Free, Concession \u00a315.50.","7820":"These prices include a 10% donation to the zoo which can be gift-aided if you wish.","7821":"This was mentioned as we were paying with no obligation to pay it.","7822":"The zoo is very hilly which wasn't a problem to us but may be for the less mobile.","7823":"We were asked if we had any mobility problems when paying so I assume the zoo has a solution if people do have problems.","7824":"There was a wide range of very interesting animals to see but the main attractions were the lions and cubs, tigers, koalas and Giant Pandas.","7825":"The main disappointment was the penguin parade with only 2 penguins.","7826":"As expected on a cold December day, some animals were only indoors and not particular active but it didn't detract from the enjoyment.","7827":"One of the cafes was open which had a variety of hot and cold food and drinks at reasonable prices.","7828":"We used it as we didn't want to have a picnic in the damp and cold.","7829":"Overall the whole family had an enjoyable time and we would recommend it.","7830":"My family of 5 drove up from Liverpool for a day at the zoo and to do the lantern night walk.","7831":"The zoo is really good, we had a great show by one of the sun bears who was stood on top of the wooden framework outside.","7832":"We made our way up to the top of the zoo to see the panda's which my daughter has been waiting a long time to see.","7833":"The male panda was out and active eating his food and the talk was really informative.","7834":"we then worked our way down the hill visiting each section of the zoo.","7835":"We visited the grassland restaurant for some dinner .","7836":"pizza x2 chips x1 garlic bread and 2 drinks was \u00a325  pretty reasonable as the drinks are refill's.","7837":"We made our back to the entrance after walking back to see the pandas for a 2nd time, at this time it was half an hour before closing and and hour before we was due to come back for the lantern walk.","7838":"The lantern walk is pretty magical for the kids, the way its laid out is you go back in time and travel back to the present discovering all about the Jurassic world and periods .","7839":"As an adult i even ejoyed it and the lights they have on are amazing.","7840":"I would highly recommend going","7841":"Had a great time and enjoyed the vast amount of animals.","7842":"Really helpful staff.","7843":"Well worth it.","7844":"Loads of seating and outdoor areas for eating and drinking.","7845":"Great range of animals , esp the pandas","7846":"Hey it was winter, of course it\u2019ll be cold and animal activity will be at its lowest, so I was a little disappointed there wasn\u2019t an off peak price as such.","7847":"Luckily one of us had a student card so wasn\u2019t too bad.","7848":"Nice variety of animals, although the layout is a bit odd.","7849":"Felt like I missed a few things and there was no obvious route though the park.","7850":"Which was very hilly, and basically an uphill climb to the pandas new home and then back down.","7851":"The staff were very helpful in the visitor centre although hardly any to be seen anywhere else.","7852":"If you\u2019re going to go, come in the warmer months when the animals and staff will be outside","7853":"Would go back and enjoy it more in warmer weather ..","7854":"Penguins and panda main  attractions,is on quite a steep hill , pram pushers can struggle ,,","7855":"Visited Edinburgh Zoo in the evening for their Giant Lantern show and it was brilliant.","7856":"The art sculptures were very detailed and looked amazing.","7857":"It was good that we were able to go round as many times as we\u2019d like until the ticket time ran out.","7858":"Would recommend visiting!","7859":"A fantastic zoo with a wide range of brilliant, we\u2019ll-cared-for animals from around the world.","7860":"Highlights: Pandas, rhinos, penguins, meerkats, and chimpanzees.","7861":"Some seriously world-class exhibitions throughout the zoo!","7862":"The shows were fantastic and we\u2019d highly recommend the penguin parade if your planning a visit.","7863":"If you want to see the panda feeding, get in early!","7864":"Wear a comfortable pair of walking shoes and be prepared for some uphill climbs towards the back of the zoo.","7865":"Plan for an entire day if you want to squeeze in everything.","7866":"We\u2019d have given the zoo 5 stars if not for the messiness in some areas (although I\u2019m seriously not complaining - the weather wouldn\u2019t make keeping the zoo clean an easy job!).","7867":"I am really not a fan of zoos but this took me by surprise.","7868":"Lots of space, quiet, beautifully looked after.","7869":"The animals were adorable and they all seemed content and happy where we could tell.","7870":"I think this is the best zoo I\u2019ve been to, all of the animals had brilliant enclosures especially the penguins and pandas.","7871":"The day we came was rainy and windy so most of the animals were indoors but this meant we saw most of them!","7872":"We had lunch in the grasslands restaurant and it was reasonably priced and the portions were big.","7873":"I really enjoyed my day here, we spent a good four hours walking around and I still think we missed certain parts!","7874":"The whole zoo is very hilly which we were told at entrance so this is something to consider before visiting with small children and elderly.","7875":"If you are in or around Edinburgh I would definitely recommend visiting here, rain or sun you will have a good day.","7876":"Absolutely fantastic,  very clean , excellent value.","7877":"Food nice , very well priced .","7878":"Would definitely recommend","7879":"It was so amazing to see the penguins march, and my children loved it!","7880":"Great zoo with great staff and animals!","7881":"Really enjoyed our trip to Edinburgh zoo.","7882":"Greay variety of animals, although the lions were off show due to having cubs, which is fair enough and really responsible of the zoo to let them have time alone :)","7883":"The zoo is on a big hill, there's plenty of walking to do, so make sure you wear comfy shoes.","7884":"My favourite part was seeing the pandas, make sure you pay them a visit.","7885":"And try to catch the penguin parade if you can!","7886":"Great If you want to see pigeons and squirels, didn't see a right lot else most of them animals werent out in the pens","7887":"Spent a lovely day out at Edinburgh zoo have to say the animal attractions and enclosures done really well the talks informative and friendlyBut if you go wear comfortable shoes as it's a lot of walking and everything seems to be uphill so don't make evening plans lolThe lion cubs have to be seen and the pandasDown point some animals I would expect to see in a zoo of this size not there (crocodiles, giraffes, elephants, gorillas etc) but all round a good day","7888":"Amazing  exhibition we throughly enjoyed walking around the zoo, looking at the giant sculptures.","7889":"The lighting and sculptures were excellent.","7890":"Well worth a visit.","7891":"This is a beautiful zoo and an amazing place to visit, the only reason it isn't a 5 is because you have to be very fit to climb the massive incline to see the animals.","7892":"In their defense however you can get a ride to the top and work your way down, it really is worth the visit","7893":"My sister and I went to Edinburgh Zoo to see the Chinese Lantern Festival.","7894":"I had heard it was worth seeing and had been shown some photographs.","7895":"We were certainly not disappointed, it is amazing, really impressive.","7896":"We spent almost two hours there but realistically could have spent much longer.","7897":"A lovely and unusual venue for a Christmas party night with friends.","7898":"Venue however was cold.","7899":"Meal was very tasty although basic Christmas fare.","7900":"Good disco and dancing warmed us up!","7901":"Table was cleared a little too promptly at the end of the night so felt we were rushed out the door.","7902":"Even our drinks were cleared while we were dancing but it didn't spoil our night thankfully.","7903":"We visited here before 3 years ago and was so impressed to see the pandas then, mind you tian tian slept for most of the day so we didn't get to see her but yesterday we were super lucky!","7904":"Tian tian was out for a good hour meaning lots of lovely photos and videos (she is beautiful) infact seeing the pandas is a priceless experience \ud83d\udc3cCharlie was kind enough to drive us to the top (too steep a walk for us) and on the way up he told us about the Chinese lantern festivals and the other animals as we passed them, very informative and a very kind d, friendly man, thank you Charlie!Our only negative would be the service in the penguin cafe, the lady who served us was not very welcoming and was quite abrupt.","7905":"The lost lanterns on show in December\/ January are  amazing 1 hour 45 minutes to walk around with such a vibrant colourful show, it was breathtaking our grandchildren loved every second, it told the story of the dinosaurs over millions of years, the only light was the hundreds of dinosaurs and lanterns hanging in the trees, the tunnels of lights breathtaking.","7906":"The huge rip off was the food, pre cooked food rolled in paper, just warm, like cardboard, extremely over priced.","7907":"\u00a323 for 3 plane burger and chips,2 drinks.","7908":"The cafe staff were very friendly, maybe felt sorry for the customers?","7909":"The zoo was really lovely, there was lots of animals to look at and also lots of shows\/talks to attend which were given to us on a map when we came in.","7910":"We also pre bought our tickets before we went so it was super easy to get in.","7911":"The zoo was quite spacious however it had a lot of steep hills which may limit parts of the zoo to certain visitors, lots of walk throughs and chances to see the animals in their \u201chouses\u201d so you didn\u2019t miss out.","7912":"The only downside I found was that you had to pay for parking even if you had previous bought a ticket, \u00a34 for the car!","7913":"Not many spaces either for how popular the zoo is","7914":"Enjoyed our day, the man doing the talks (not sure his name, impressive beard!) is really good, very friendly, funny and informative!Could maybe do with more signage\/facts about some of the animals.","7915":"Ended up missing the chimpanzees because we didn't realise they were there, could be us being silly though!Slightly more expensive than other zoos especially with parking but worth it if it all goes to looking after the animals :)","7916":"The emphasis put on conservation and reducing plastic pollution in the talks is good, maybe add more bottle bins around the zoo to encourage people to recycle?Overall very enjoyable, I'm sure the animals are more active in the summer visiting in november means a lot of animals are indoors but what can you do!","7917":"Rather them be warm than forced outside.","7918":"Also people need to stop whining about not being able to see pandas, if they want to come out they will, if not it's not the zoo keepers fault!","7919":"My wife and I have just completed 12 months as members of the Edinburgh Zooalogical Society.","7920":"Have no doubts the reason for this was to see the pandas.","7921":"In 14 visits over a 12 month period we were successful in seeing a panda only 4 times.","7922":"The female panda was never on view.","7923":"The male was seen 4 times, twice asleep and not moving, twice walking around and eating.","7924":"So 2 fantastic viewings over a year.","7925":"The panda's new pens look impresive but do not make them more accessible to the public.","7926":"It is also unforgiveable that there is no live camera feed to see the pandas on the screens outside their pens when they are inside and not on public view.","7927":"This is standard at the zoo's, who have pandas, in Europe that we have visited.","7928":"Overall the zoo is very shabby and from our experience it is rare that more that about two thirds of the animals they have were on show.","7929":"The zoo regularly claim animals are not on show for animal welfare reasons.","7930":"That is fine but compared to many other zoos visited we can only conclude that either they have a lot of unhealthy animals or they apply different standards to most zoos who care about the customer experience.","7931":"Overall very disappointing","7932":"and we will not be renewing the society membership.","7933":"Visited on our day in Edinburgh, and went about an hour after opening.","7934":"Got straight through but we\u2019re lucky to park, as that is on a first come first served basis, regardless if you pre paid for a ticket.","7935":"Parking is limited for the size of the zoo.","7936":"During our visit, a large amount of attractions were closed (understandably with the lions as they had cubs) but there is no pre warning of any of these.","7937":"Sort of ruined the day.","7938":"Don\u2019t expect to be wowed by the pandas, they basically do nothing.","7939":"Again nothing that can be done about this so can\u2019t dwell on that too much.","7940":"The zoo is on a steep hill, so unless you\u2019re in decent shape it can really wear on you.","7941":"Luckily we\u2019re both young and active, but I can\u2019t imagine how difficult it must be for older folk or parents with prams\/young children.","7942":"Overall, it\u2019s no more special a zoo than any other.","7943":"Was a bit let down.","7944":"Really enjoyed our trip to the zoo!","7945":"It was very quiet but that suited us!We looked forward to the penguin parade, however none of them fancied a walk about.","7946":"Don\u2019t blame them, it was cold!Lion cubs were adorable, as were the giant pandas.","7947":"My particular favourite was Goonaroo the Koala!!!Mostly importantly though we were very impressed by the Penguin Talk.","7948":"The two ladies that were doing it and we learnt a lot about the three breeds of penguins they have.","7949":"Very hilly, which was ok for us but not others.","7950":"Few animals.","7951":"Several of them looked lonely and\/or distressed.","7952":"Pandas were great but it seems they\u2019re the only ones with a nice enclosure.","7953":"We just went today, 18th November.","7954":"It was - 1 Degrees Celsius today.","7955":"So as you can imagine a lot of the animals were inside their indoor areas and huts.","7956":"We didn't see a whole lot as a result but I imagine that on a warm day or any other day the zoo would be thriving within their enclosures!Tickets are standard prices for a zoo, and the staff were friendly at the ticket desk.","7957":"It took us more than 2.5 hours to get around.","7958":"So give yourself at least 3 hours!What I will advise is that this zoo is on a steep, really high hill.","7959":"So you will be walking up and down the hill for as long as you are at the zoo.","7960":"For Accessibility (infants,elderly or wheelchair users etc.), the zoo have a good few options which you can find out at the ticket desk.","7961":"We managed fine.","7962":"It was a bit of a light trek that we weren't expecting but nothing crazy.","7963":"People were going up and down it with buggies etc, so it's fine.","7964":"The zoo itself is very well laid out and is fun to see all the different exhibits.","7965":"You can hand feed parakeets which is amazing.","7966":"There are also a variety of wildlife talks throughout the day.","7967":"I was pleasantly surprised with these talks as they were heavily surrounded with scientific studies of the animals and conservation in the wild.","7968":"I thought this was brilliant and incredibly eye opening!There are also a lot of dedicated volunteers of RZSS in the zoo, who will give you a lot of detailed information on the animals and the zoo etc if you want it.","7969":"These volunteers are strolling around near exhibits if you need them, they're also very friendly and good chat!There are loads of playgrounds for children spread out around the zoo and there are a lot of restaurants as well.","7970":"Can't wait to return in the summer to see the zoo when it's not freezing weather!","7971":"We were really looking forward to visiting Edinburgh Zoo.","7972":"In all we spent about an hour and a half there, most of it was walking around attempting to catch sight of an animal.","7973":"There were lots of empty spaces and bits blocked off (staff only) that we were unable to go down.","7974":"More concerning was the general vibe that the animals gave off.","7975":"We've been to other zoos and the animals are definitely more animated.","7976":"The keepers linger around the enclosures and appear to have a great relationship with the animals.","7977":"Aside from the couple of staff we saw preparing to feed the pandas, there really weren't any members of staff around.","7978":"It was really nice to see the range of penguins, but their enclosure paled to the quality of that we saw at Chester, Dudley, and at the Welsh Mountain Zoo.","7979":"There were a couple of animals, the koalas and pandas, that you couldn't see anywhere else in the UK so it was pleasant to see them.","7980":"Overall though, a pretty depressing place.","7981":"We were eager to leave.","7982":"We visited Edinburgh zoo, and by all means was impressed!","7983":"The accommodation provided for the animals is beautiful, the talks are informative and funny and the animals on offer to see are unique and charismatic.","7984":"Very very hilly so would consider this before buying tickets.","7985":"But tickets are reasonably priced, the cafes slightly overpriced but as expected and surprisingly the gift shop was cheap!Only criticism is that the lorikeet exhibit was closed meaning we didn't get to see them.","7986":"Lots of babies to see, and animals are fed throughout the day (not at talk sessions)","7987":"so there's a chance you may accidentally see a species being fed.","7988":"Thank you for an amazing trip!!!","7989":"It was the best experience we had today.","7990":"The whole exhibition takes about 1 hr 30 minutes to enjoy and to see every single creature.","7991":"Good for all ages.","7992":"Absolutely recommending it 100 %.","7993":"Was a great day, literally well worth the money.","7994":"So much to see, you will not be disappointed.","7995":"Enough to keep you entertained for the full day.","7996":"amazing place, animals look happy and have lots of space, the zoo itself is on a hill and when getting tickets the staff asked if we needed any help with the distance, this was brilliant as i had recently hurt my foot so we got a free of charge lift to the top of the hill by one of the staff and then could walk down at our leisure, the staff member told us information about the zoo\/animals on the journey up too, 5* for this, really made the visit better for me!plus got to see pandas in the uk which is an unreal experience, cannot fault it :)","7997":"Me and my girlfriend both being massive fans of anything to do with animals decided to come to Edinburgh to see the zoo and see the panda's.","7998":"Luckily we did get to see one of the panda's which was an amazing site to see which we stood and watched for around 30-45minutes.","7999":"What was a great idea by the zoo was the mobility car that would take you and pick you up.","8000":"That is unbelievable as this zoo is seriously hilly.","8001":"The enclosures on the other hand are probably some of the best we have seen in Europe.","8002":"Absolutely outstanding and no natural.","8003":"Negatives would be how disappointed we were at the lack of main conservation animals, i.e elephants and giraffes.","8004":"We are aware giraffes are coming in but to not see elephants in a zoo is bizarre.","8005":"The lack of aquatic life and reptilians also was a massive shame as zoos should be able to display all things big and small as people come to zoos to see things they don't see everyday.","8006":"It was nice to see that they done a reptile talk although no reptiles on display.","8007":"A Australian blue tongue skink and a Honduran milk snake was brought out for people to hold.","8008":"All in all quite disappointed with the overall  aspect of the zoo and thought honestly it would be a lot better.","8009":"Thank you to the staff who were very helpful","8010":"We saved money by booking tickets on line in advance having checked the weather forecast.","8011":"We came mainly to see the pandas, which were great.","8012":"I also managed to take a photo of a koala during the 3 seconds it looked up from it's sleep.","8013":"The penguins were great, very photogenic.","8014":"Only 3 chose to come out for the penguin parade.","8015":"The keepers do stress that it's totally voluntary on the part of the penguins and they don't encourage them with food.","8016":"We also caught the red pandas during an unexpected bout of activity.","8017":"We tried to look for the lemurs and highland wild cats a couple of times but didn't see any unfortunately.","8018":"Nevertheless we had a great day and felt it was well worthwhile.","8019":"Travelled to see the Giant Pandas.","8020":"Saw both inside and outside enclosures - absolutely beautiful.","8021":"Couldn't have been better.","8022":"Saw Penguin Parade.","8023":"Saw ALL the other animals except one.","8024":"Sometime you just have to wait a while, or look way up at the exhibit if there are trees - they might not be right in front.","8025":"We really enjoyed this trip as it was very full of animals.","8026":"Were worried due to the reviews.","8027":"Stopped for a quick coffee and that was delicious.","8028":"Staff were very polite and helpful.","8029":"Gift shop was great too.","8030":"Hillside was walkable.","8031":"Enclosures seemed natural, not \"overgrown\".","8032":"Bus from train station only took a few minutes.","8033":"Excellent & only wish we could have spent more time there.","8034":"It was perfect!!","8035":"We went because we wanted to see the pandas.","8036":"They were starting work for the lantern festival in November but that wasn't yet open so there was some works going on where we had to take detours.","8037":"Looks like that will be a lovely experience when it opens.","8038":"There is lots of walking up and down hills in this zoo, which I don't mind, but then maps become hard to read and you end up missing some animals as they are higgeldy piggeldy.","8039":"The outside area for the pandas is wonderful, so much space, but unfortunately our trek there was unsuccessful as they were both inside.","8040":"The glass was so reflective all we could see was people's reflections until we put a camera to the glass and took a picture.","8041":"This needs to be thought out a bit better.","8042":"A bit disappointed with the penguin walk as only two penguins decided to do the walk.","8043":"I am glad they're not forced to do it, but would have liked to see more.","8044":"Loved the bird feeding, not bad for \u00a31.","8045":"Our own food was limited, and expensive for what it was although very tasty soup.","8046":"Great zoo on a massive hill side.","8047":"If you're unsteady on your feet, take one of the zoo's scooters to get up the hill.","8048":"Absolutely love coming to visit Edinburgh Zoo.","8049":"Great to see the Pandas in new enclosures too.","8050":"The keepers are very friendly, approachable and knowledgeable.","8051":"All in all a lovely experience.","8052":"Just one thing that possibly lets it down is the staff in the cafe.","8053":"Rude is as polite as I can say on here.","8054":"One guy in particular who served at the till.","8055":"He was horrible to the ladies in front of me, then walked of as soon as my payment went through.","8056":"I said excuse me could I have the receipt and also my sandwich toasted (as that's what it was meant to be) and he just said go and moved my things along the counter and served the couple that came up behind me.","8057":"I managed to eat some of the sandwich but wish I had gone to the restaurant opposite and paid double.","8058":"Fantastic place plenty too see.","8059":"I loved Penguin rock so many different species of penguin.","8060":"My granddaughter thought the sun bathing ones were fake until it jumped up at her.","8061":"Great day out we seen the lion cubs and the Giant pandas were very lively","8062":"Had such a lovely day today at Edinburgh Zoo.","8063":"It\u2019s clear to see the animals are very looked after and the keepers are so knowledgeable and  passionate about conservation and sustainability.","8064":"Instead of just filling us with lots of facts, additionally the keepers speak about the very real events happening currently and how they are affecting the future of a lot of species.","8065":"The money we spend on tickets goes into keeping those animals safe and looked after.","8066":"The zoo even has a dove which they have bred successfully which is extinct in the wild.","8067":"It was well worth the rainy day, get the 26 Lothian bus to the zoo.","8068":"I loved getting to see a panda and the tiger is absolutely stunning.","8069":"I used to love Edinburgh Zoo but it has went down hill in the last 10 years.","8070":"Alot of empty spaces and over grown areas that yes maybe leaving for bees and insects but it's just very messy.","8071":"You can have overgrown areas but this has been delivered poorly.","8072":"It is on a hill but that I'm not bothered about but the layout and poor signage it has no flow can easy miss bits if you don't have a map to hand.","8073":"Lots of kiosks around but were all closed.","8074":"Couldn't get into one place as had to have a reservation apparently.","8075":"Other place was basic but expensive.","8076":"I just find it so overpriced for what you get.","8077":"Five sisters Zoo, West Calder near Livingston is far better and way more fun for kids.","8078":"Went here when I was a kid.","8079":"Better conditions than 30 years ago.","8080":"Highlight was always the penguin walk.","8081":"I remember 100\u2019s but only 2 took the stroll when we went.","8082":"Pandas are cool.","8083":"Lorikeets (small parrots) are great fun.","8084":"\u00a31 for a small pot of nectar which you hold and they land on your arm and feed.#26 bus from the city drops you outside.","8085":"Great zoo but be prepared for a good cardio workout.","8086":"It is the only zoo I have visited that is on the side of a hill.","8087":"You will be walking up and down from exhibit to exhibit.","8088":"They do provide shuttle service for those that may have difficulties on the walk.","8089":"A must has to be the Penguin walk!!","8090":"You must be prepared with your cell phone camera for this amazing march.","8091":"Great day out at Edinburgh Zoo.","8092":"Buy your tickets in advance for  a discount, plus a much shorter entry queue.","8093":"This is a really well set out zoo with a great variety of animals.","8094":"There are Pandas and Koalas that are unmissable.","8095":"Lots of talks by the keepers, the rhinos were so interesting and quite tame, and the keeper explained a lot about the work the zoo does.","8096":"The penguin parade was hilarious, and very entertaining.","8097":"On a practical note, the bus stops right outside the zoo.","8098":"Good coffee and cakes available at reasonable prices, and plenty of picnic spots.","8099":"The shop was reasonable too with more than just the usual plastic rubbish, some really nice books for example.","8100":"All the staff were approachable and friendly and seemed genuinely pleased to meet the public and promote the work of the zoo","8101":"Decent parking facilities and easy to find, this hilly zoo provides good walking apart from many different animals\/birds to view.","8102":"Educational, interesting, the main point for our visit was to see the pandas, and one was on view albeit, asleep.","8103":"Good facilities for most of the animals and primates after all this is a zoo and as hard as it is for me personally to visit a zoo and because I have seen all of this mammals\/animals in the wild(apart from the pandas), my friends enjoyed the visit.","8104":"Zoo's are still needed for educational purpose and for most people and especially children their only chance to see such animals interacting with each other.","8105":"The penguin talk was very interesting and the staff do a valiant vocational job.","8106":"A good visit but with mixed feelings...","8107":"We had a great time.","8108":"We were pleased with the enclosures.","8109":"Was a bit worried about the sun bears pacing but that ended up to be excitement as they were being let outside.","8110":"Their outside enclosure had so much enrichment.","8111":"We ate at one of the restaurant and the food was great, especially the hot chocolate which was the best I\u2019d have.","8112":"The penguin walk was so lovely.","8113":"I also loved the Chimp enclosures.","8114":"Visited the zoo on a cold, wet day with my husband and 13 year old son.","8115":"We all had a brilliant time.","8116":"We saw lots of different animals and yes some enclosures were empty but considering the weather we were expecting that!","8117":"The penguins were lovely to watch but our absolute favourites were the pandas!!","8118":"We were lucky that they were both in their indoor homes and were active while we were there.","8119":"We stood watching them for ages.","8120":"The zoo is very spaced out so be prepared for lots of walking, a lot of it up hill.","8121":"We had lunch at the penguin cafe which was nice if a little expensive.","8122":"We would love to return.","8123":"I took my family of 12 to the zoo last week, whilst visiting edinburgh.","8124":"I checked before hand about mobility issues and was informed that although built-on a steep hill there was motorised scooters available, we arrived at opening time, and was offered transport instead of the use of a scooter, we just had to phone a nunber.","8125":"We asked for transport for three of us , and was told ten minutes, twenty minutes later a grumpy chap arrived in a car and said he only had room for two of us, my 90 year old mother and disabled daughter went in the car and I had to walk,  being a pensioner who walks with a crutch, it was not the response I had expected.","8126":"The walk was difficult as I had to try and do it at speed as the rest of my party was already at the panda house.","8127":"I was left in pain and exhausted and the rest of the day was spoilt.","8128":"The pandas were unfortunately not to be seen, but that's life!","8129":"Sadly I can not recommend the zoo and certainly not their disabled policys.","8130":"An expensive day out for us.","8131":"The zoo keeper in the koala house was lovely, as was the stuff in grasslands.","8132":"We, family with two kids, went to visit Edinburgh Zoo first for penguins, but also for many other beautiful animals.","8133":"We were not dissapointed, the day at the zoo was wonderful.","8134":"The zoo is well maintained and offers good settings to observe the animals, and additionally many special events during the day.","8135":"We visited the zoo today, we started at the top (and when I say the top it\u2019s all uphill) and worked our way back down.","8136":"The zoo itself is very clean and the facilities are brilliant.","8137":"We saw everything we wanted to","8138":"but I think we may have visited at the wrong time of year as some of the animals weren\u2019t out but that was fine as the colder is starting to set in.","8139":"Still good value for money and we spent approximately 5 hours walking around.","8140":"The map of the zoo is very helpful and easy to follow.","8141":"Would visit again if coming back to Edinburgh","8142":"The only place to see pandas and Koalas in the UK.","8143":"They were so amazing to see and we loved seeing them.","8144":"The zoo is on a hill so can get quite tiring at times.","8145":"Living in Chester we're rather spoiled for zoo content","8146":"but we had a fabulous visit to Edinburgh Zoo.","8147":"Although significantly smaller than Chester and hilly (so not very buggy or wheelchair friendly) this is a great place to visit.","8148":"The staff at reception were eager to ensure that any problems we might have had accessing the zoo could be taken catered for.","8149":"The signage is very clear and the enclosures very environmentally rich for the animals.","8150":"Panda viewing is great and like all the other animals, done in a way that is sensitive to the animal's needs primarily - even if it does mean the koala's were able to hide very effectively in the leaves!","8151":"The penguins especially are a hoot!Bit of trek out of the city but well served by public transport and the \u00a31.70 fare for any distance is great value.","8152":"If you're in Edinburgh for more than a coupe of days or are an animal lover, it's a great option","8153":"We visited Edinburgh zoo on an October afternoon.","8154":"They animals were few and far between.","8155":"There were many areas where here was nothing to see at all.","8156":"Lots of money seems to have been spent on plastic dinosaurs and fake cactus but the animals were sadly depleted.","8157":"There was one koala, 2 zebra, one tiger and a panda that we saw.","8158":"The whole place is tatty.","8159":"The dining areas were filthy!","8160":"Food all over the floor and I mean ALL over the floor.","8161":"It\u2019s a very steep walk to see everything(or not as the case may be!).","8162":"We were fit and able to do it with no problem it if you have any mobility issues give it a wide berth.","8163":"The price to get in is pretty expensive considering how bad the park is.","8164":"There is hardly any animals there and what there was, there was only one of each.","8165":"Alot of them looked really depressed.","8166":"Especially the koalas, DONT buy food there, honestly the worst food I've ever tasted and you'll save yourself a fortune.","8167":"Was a nice walk around ,best part was the penguins ,alot of enclosures no animals to be seen or too far away, please never waste your money in food place !!","8168":"We got burger chips and a kids dog and chips and 2 drinks \u00a321 50!!!","8169":"My burger was cold and resembled squashed dog food and my daughters hot dog was rock hard we had a bite out of each and left them and ate just a few chips , absolutely worst food I've ever had in my life , had fast food at venues before but never anything this dire , take packed lunch and save yourself money and being left hungry !","8170":"We were only here 2 and half hours so not really worth price","8171":"but hey we tried it but wont be back","8172":"This was a place that I've wanted to visit for some time, and a recent meeting gave me the chance, but came away with mixed feelings.","8173":"Entrance fee was a little high and have been to better zoos for less.","8174":"Everything was explained,with talk times highlighted during the day.","8175":"It must be noted it is built on a hill, but help is available for access to higher places.","8176":"Certain animals were a little shy or sleeping, but got to see the main attraction,the Pandas.","8177":"The viewing glass is poor and reflections make visibility patchy to a number of exhibits, and a few enclosures closed.","8178":"I know it's not the height of the season but the day was fine, not to busy, and got to see most of the exibits.","8179":"Great play areas for the kids, maybe bring a picnic.","8180":"A reasonable 5 hours to cover everything.","8181":"Before I start about the animals I thought it best to stress that the zoo is on a hill and so anyone with walking difficulties may struggle as in parts it is quite steep.","8182":"I think you can get wheelchair assistance if you mention it to the staff when buying tickets.","8183":"Anyway onto the zoo and animals....as I have said the zoo is on a hill so could be quite challenging for some people but is a very nice walk especially when the sun is shining.","8184":"All the animals were up and about and in the main were very photogenic.","8185":"We struggled with the panda to start with but with a little bit of patience he soon began to show off!","8186":"It took us just over 4 hours to see all the animals and watch the penguin parade which is really cute.","8187":"The penguin cafe served some really nice lentil soup which was reasonably priced and the coffee was good too.","8188":"All in all a really good day out.","8189":"Took my wife and 2 girls to the zoo along with my son and his girlfriend, we spent all day there and it was brilliant.","8190":"The animals were active and looked really happy, our favourites were the penguins and the gibbons.","8191":"All round the zoo experience was amazing, the animals were amazing and myself and the family had a truly wonderful time.","8192":"Had a great day when I visited Edinburgh Zoo with my daughters who are both in their twenties.","8193":"The weather was beautiful and we saw most of the animals.","8194":"It was a treat to see both pandas and koala bears and the penguin enclosure is second to none.","8195":"The only downside is it's very hilly and there are a lot of steps but that wasn't a problem for us.","8196":"Unfortunately we didn't get to see the new lion cubs but hopefully next time I visit in the summer they'll be out.","8197":"Good zoo and couldn\u2019t wait to see the panda \ud83d\udc3cBut a really poor viewing area.","8198":"Also this zoo is built into a hillside so the whole attraction is up hill from the entrance....","8199":"Chester zoo is still my fave.","8200":"Great day out, lots of hills but that wasn\u2019t a problem for us.","8201":"We got to see the Pandas in their indoor enclosures and the Koala bears were adorable.","8202":"We enjoyed the penguin parade, the keeper was very entertaining.","8203":"Had lunch in the Grasslands restaurant, food and service was good.","8204":"Saw the Lions without their cubs despite being told beforehand they were not on display!","8205":"The only negative was that the glass into some of the enclosures was very poor in the sun.","8206":"We went here whilst staying in Edinburgh as a small family.","8207":"This was our last stop before a 5 hour drive, so we were hoping this would give us all a bit of energy and excitement.","8208":"However, all the enclosures were cages and just looked awful.","8209":"They could've themed the cages or tried to make them look nicer.","8210":"The animals did not look happy at all (compared to another zoo we've been to).","8211":"We left after 30 minutes and would not recommend, however, there was a nice view.","8212":"Just a point to note its built on a hill, a lot of inclines so be ready for that.","8213":"A great day out at the zoo.","8214":"Arrived and queues up to get in as soon as it opened.","8215":"Both kids have Blue Peter badges so got in for free - result.","8216":"Adult tickets around \u00a320.","8217":"Car parking available on a first come\/ first services basis.","8218":"A spread out zoo which was reasonably easy to get around.","8219":"It\u2019s on quite a steep hill so hard work if you had mobility issues or a heavy buggy.","8220":"The staff were very helpful.","8221":"A few of the enclosures were closed for maintainence.","8222":"Lots of areas to have a picnic.","8223":"We are in the cafe which was expensive for what it was but reasonably standard.","8224":"Came to see the pandas but loved the whole place.","8225":"Great range of staff.","8226":"The walk around is good with everything given room but don\u2019t feel it\u2019s too spread out like other zoos.","8227":"The staff were informative and friendly.","8228":"We came here purely for the giant panda\u2019s and everything else is such a bonus (especially the Penguin walkthrough)!","8229":"Quite hilly which is to be expected in Edinburgh but lots of resting spots and beautiful animals to see!","8230":"Definitely a must visit if you\u2019re in the area as we would most certainly return for more visits!","8231":"We spent a good hour in the Panda area just admiring them!!","8232":"When we visited the zoo appeared quiet.","8233":"The weather was luckily nice for October which allowed us to walk around without in the indoor closures being cramped.","8234":"The Zoo is well spread out over a lot of land which requires a lot of walking sometimes on steep hills so would recommend comfortable footwear.","8235":"However, we felt this broke up large crowds and allowed sufficient time to view each enclosure.","8236":"Throughout the day there are great talks about different animals which gives you the impression the keepers genuinely care about each animal and their future.","8237":"We heard a lot of guest saying the animals are 'boring' and 'just sleeping in their enclosures' but a lot of the animal are there to prevent extinction not just to entertain people and to be fair it was cold and windy","8238":"so I don't blame them!","8239":"A lot of the talks explained why they no longer feed the animals at set talk times when the public are present - which makes alot of sense!The Penguin walk was very good and the window where you can see them swim was also very good!","8240":"We only managed to see one of the panda's as they came out of their enclosure about lunch time to snack on some fruit and salad.","8241":"We were unfortunate to go when the lion enclosure was closed due to new cubs but we completely understand why!All the Zoo Keepers were friendly and always on hand to answer any questions.","8242":"The only negatives are the \u00a34 parking fee and the viewing windows at the panda's as it was very difficult to see in as all you can see is the trees and sky in the reflection.","8243":"The obvious appeal for Edinburgh Zoo are the Giant Pandas and rightly so.","8244":"The Pandas themselves are very lazy beats and I'm not sure I seen them move on our visit.","8245":"It is one of the more expensive Zoos I have visited but still made for a nice day out","8246":"Travelled to Edinburgh purely to visit the zoo as I'm a major animal lover.","8247":"We live near Chester Zoo and visit quite often, and in comparison this zoo isn't as big or have as many animals but the price reflects that.","8248":"Entrance is a bit hidden from view, we assumed we'd accidentally turned in the hotel carpark but turns out it was the zoo after all.","8249":"Managed to see most animals, except the lions who are off view as she has just had her babies, warthogs and pandas.","8250":"Pandas was however because of poor designing of the enclosure.","8251":"You cannot see through the large glass windows due to the reflections.","8252":"I could see a panda ear when someone stood blocking the sun from the window but apart from that everyone walked away having seen nothing.","8253":"I understand animals need their privacy but this just needs a sun shade putting up and it'd be fantastic.","8254":"Lot of money has gone into the enclosure, but it's all for nothing if we can't see anything.","8255":"We were done and back in the car just under 4hrs which I expected so if you're after a full day's activity this isn't it.","8256":"I am aware the zoo is making some changes however they failed to mention this when I was booking the tickets !","8257":"Which would\u2019ve been nice to know !","8258":"Felt extremely disappointed when arriving here and actually questioning what I had paid for ?","8259":"The older enclosures were run down and you could barely get a good view of the animals... as for some of the new ones such as the pandas they were behind a pane of glass which was in the reflection of the sun so you couldn\u2019t even see the pandas, you\u2019d be lucky enough if you did!","8260":"As well as this both the lions and the tigers were not on display again wasn\u2019t notified about this which is disappointing as you\u2019re paying to see animals and I barely saw any !","8261":"The food at the restaurant was extortionate, which was predicted but is it necessary to charge ridiculous amounts after what we paid to get in!","8262":"If you\u2019re planning to visit bring your own food.","8263":"There were some highlights to the day such as the brilliant birds were... well brilliant!!","8264":"You could buy a tub of food for \u00a31 and the birds would come and sit on you which was a lovely experience and also the talk on the one horned rhino was good you can see the rhinos up close and personal !","8265":"First visit in a long time.","8266":"There have been a lot of updates to enclosures which are great improvements.","8267":"The Giant Panda enclosure was disappointing as it was difficult to see the pandas through the glass, as this is a main attraction and the zoo is the only place in the UK you can see them there should be a way to guarantee that you can see through the glass.","8268":"I did manage to get a photo by using the map provided to block out the sun.","8269":"There is a lot to see and informative talks by the staff on the different animals.","8270":"Just be prepared that you may not see all you want to see","8271":"Some of the enclosures are really good but a lot of the older ones (nearer the entrance) appear to be in need of serious work.","8272":"There are various paths closed and some enclosures \u2018closed due to essential maintenance\u2019 - we went on a week day and the only maintenance that was going on across the entire site was the odd bit of gardening in the public areas.","8273":"The penguin enclosure is still as good as it was when I last visited 21 years ago.","8274":"The main purpose of the visit however was to see the Pandas.","8275":"What a joke that was.","8276":"The new enclosures look great for them but one of the pandas was nowhere to be seen either inside or out, and the other was asleep inside.","8277":"That\u2019s fair play BUT the viewing windows into the houses - why the hell hasn\u2019t the zoo used non-reflective glass?","8278":"All you can see is reflections of the trees and daylight - irrespective of the time of day (we tried to see them at 3 different times of day during the trip).","8279":"There are huge planters under the viewing windows designed to keep people away from the windows, so unless you\u2019re tall enough (6ft or so) to lean over these to put your hands over the glass to get a half-decent view, I honestly wouldn\u2019t bother trying to see them if they are inside.","8280":"My other main gripe was the jungle cafe - \u00a39 for a salad?!","8281":"Are you guys for real?","8282":"The baguettes aren\u2019t much better - there was 3 salad leaves, 3 super thin slices of tomato and a slice of ham - and for that, it was the best part of a fiver.","8283":"Was so big and amazing.","8284":"Go at your own speed and take your time.","8285":"Was lovely to see the animals, and some that I've never seen before close il untill now.","8286":"Was a very enjoyable day","8287":"October, it was breezy and quite cold.","8288":"I think (hope) that may be the reason that many of the animals were no where to be seen, neither inside or outside their enclosures.","8289":"The lions were out of bounds due to a young cub which was totally reasonable but where was the Rhino for example, and many others.","8290":"The two Pandas have been moved to new enclosures.","8291":"Why oh why did they not use non reflective glass to the viewing areas.","8292":"One Panda was asleep on a ledge to the side of the enclosure but due to the reflections in the glass all you could see was the trees, and the people peering in trying to see it.","8293":"Photographs were impossible.","8294":"There was a lot of disappointed people and a lot of grumbles.","8295":"It's not a cheap place to visit, \u00a318 adult, \u00a39 child, and it's another \u00a34 to park your car.","8296":"Many of the animals and birds seem to be solitary exhibits, whether that's because they don't like company or not isn't always clear but many looked miserable.","8297":"On the plus side, the penquins area is good although once again non reflective glass on the underwater viewing would have been a bonus, the pelicans and flamingos were also good to see.","8298":"The Koala enclosure was a pleasure and the lady explaining the life of the Koala and the history of the ones there was really good and educational.","8299":"A mention too for the attendant at the Red Panda enclosure who explained about their way of life and the new born who was about to make an appearance.","8300":"Two highlights of the day.","8301":"So i visited here a while a go but never reviewed it!What a great zoo!","8302":"We visited this time last year when the lanterns where on.","8303":"We didn't see the lanterns but they was set up and they even looked great in the day!It's not for the faint hearted if walking isn't your thing.","8304":"The zoo goes up a...well mountain really.","8305":"It's no hill.","8306":"My poor nan couldn't see half of the zoo because she couldn't get to it.","8307":"Obviously it's all paved but it's rather steep!Overall it's reasonably priced for a zoo and we really enjoyed it","8308":"We visited 12th Oct for youngest daughter's 7th birthday treat.","8309":"There seemed to be a lot of animals missing from when we last came around 4 yrs ago..lions weren't on display, no giraffes, lots of empty enclosures.","8310":"The penguins were as entertaining as ever and probably save the zoos reputation as being a decent family attraction and we did see one of the pandas.","8311":"We weighed up our disappointment against fact that we'd visited Chester Zoo last autumn and might have been unfairly comparing them as different sites\/objectives etc","8312":"but this should be reflected in the ticket price at least..","8313":"Chester was \u00a312 more for our family of 5 and was 5* compared to  giving Edinburgh a generous 2* yesterday.","8314":"The biggest disappointment was The Jungle Court canteen.","8315":"2 plain hotdogs, 1 portion chips, 1 \"falafel burger\" (cheap white bread roll with 4 mini falafel balls laid on, no salad, no sauce, no extras \u00a35.95) 3 bottles 500ml pop and 2 small slushies (all ice no flavour) to take out came to \u00a335.00!!!","8316":"I regret paying this and really wish I'd gone back to complain..if the food justified this cost I'd have no issues but should have come to no more than \u00a320 when comparing with other outlets.","8317":"We've always loved visiting Edinburgh zoo and it still retains it's special ambience but really hope it ups it's game again soon.","8318":"Great place, so much to see, and it is remarkable just how close you can get to the animals.","8319":"The much heralded pandas were a disappointment, a long trek up the hill to the top of the park, only to find an enclosure with glass so reflective that it was extremely difficult to see the occupant, I was not the only disappointed visitor.","8320":"However, the rest of the park was wonderful.","8321":"The rhinos, red pandas and penguins a particular highlight.","8322":"The staff we dealt with were very friendly.","8323":"Buses from Princes Street very regular.","8324":"We were welcomed by meerkats, watched researchers reward a chimpanzee that was using a large touchscreen to get snacks, climbed to the top of the hill and saw a splendid view of the Pentland Hills.","8325":"The underwater view of penguins swimming was amazing!","8326":"The pandas were hiding, but I appreciated that the zoo was animal-friendly over always being people-pleasing.","8327":"We enjoyed lunch in the Penguin Cafe (especially the penguin cut-out cookie\/biscuit).","8328":"Our 21 month old grandson might have found most joy in running on the paths linking the exhibits\u2014safe freedom.","8329":"We went to Edinburgh last weekend and made a visit to the zoo to see the Panda\u2019s and the other animals .","8330":"The day was overshadowed by drizzle but enjoyed the experience and got a good picture of a panda.","8331":"Conservation is key now to protect all species and there great work is showing dividends.","8332":"If you get the chance go the penguins and wait for the parade the closest you will ever get !!","8333":"Went to the zoo today and safe to say was the worst I have ever visited, and I have been to a few.","8334":"First of all get there and told the tiger enclosure was closed due to having cups, which I think fair enough that is understandable.","8335":"Anyway after walking around pretty much every was closed for refurbishment, yet no one was working anywhere.","8336":"Wouldn't recommend to anyone, I'd see more wildlife walking around pets at home.","8337":"Edinburgh zoo is such a lovely day out, loads to see and do, it does involve a lot of uphill climbing though.","8338":"Pandas are certainly a highlight to visiting.","8339":"Even on days its raining it is still lovely to walk round.","8340":"The food outlets are expensive so recommend taking your own food and even more so if you are Coeliac like me as very little gluten free food on offer.","8341":"Loved it!","8342":"Fantastic lay out to the zoo which makes the experience feel much more intimate.","8343":"The keepers\/guides are passionate and knowledgeable and the day was very enjoyable.","8344":"Loved the hippos!","8345":"Just wish we could have stayed longer","8346":"What an amazing day out the variety of animals and the penguins walk is super cute.","8347":"I would recommend wearing trainers as it's all up hill.","8348":"You can take a picnic we did.","8349":"But the shop was really expensive.","8350":"But all in an amazing day out","8351":"Kids loved it.","8352":"Been there many times and if you like walking you will love this.","8353":"You need to be there early as car park gets really busy and traffic gets really busy at peak times","8354":"First thing, this zoo is steep!","8355":"Anyone with mobility problems would struggle with the gradiant.","8356":"Lots of steps as well.","8357":"Highlights of the day were the Giant Pandas and the Koalas, due to their uniqueness in British Zoos.","8358":"Staff and Zookeepers were all very friendly, especially the lady on the car park.","8359":"Giving out a free bumper sticker for the car park ticket a good idea.","8360":"Plenty of talks for people wanting to find out more about various animals.","8361":"Cafe prices quite expensive.","8362":"Overall, average day out, but no more than that.....","8363":"Lovely zoo, lots to see and do.","8364":"Make sure when visiting that you visit the pandas and stick around for the penguin March","8365":"Been to many zoo's over the years.","8366":"this is pretty poor really, not many animals on show, Panda's were in hiding, Lions had just had cubs apparently, so were not allowed to see them.","8367":"Walking was very hilly, wouldn't recommend this place.","8368":"We took our 16 & 17 year old sons and everyone thoroughly enjoyed the visit.","8369":"I was apprehensive having seen some of the negative reviews, but we were not disappointed.","8370":"The Zoo is very well maintained and the staff were very welcoming.","8371":"There is a wide variety of animals and seeing the Panda, Koalas and Red Panders made our visit.","8372":"I say Panda, as we saw Yuan Guang, but not his female companion.","8373":"The Keeper did mention that the Panders were more active at about 3.30pm and we were there for the morning.","8374":"The Penguin area is the best I have seen.","8375":"There is a variety of breeds and you can spend a considerable amount of time just watching them.","8376":"Such characters.","8377":"Part of the novelty is the Zoo is built on a hill.","8378":"The views of Edinburgh were amazing.","8379":"We travelled 342 miles and the visit fulfilled all expectations.","8380":"Unbelievable place and only zoo in uk with resident pandas.","8381":"Well worth the visit but zoo is based on a hill so some up hill walking needed but worth the walk to see the animals that all looked well looked after.","8382":"This is my second time visiting the Zoo.","8383":"I was with the whole family and it was all their first time.","8384":"I booked the tickets in advance to save a little money since we were a rather large group (7).","8385":"Getting to the zoo from the city centre was very easy with just one bus to get and a few stops.","8386":"When we arrived we were welcomed by the staff who were very friendly and informed us about the things happening at the zoo that day (for example that the lions would not be on show since they had just had some lion cubs born and were still too young to be outside - all of this was already on the website so we knew about it from before).","8387":"I would suggest getting very comfortable walking shoes as it is mostly uphill (they do offer a van service to take you to the top of the hill).","8388":"The animals themselves were a lot of fun to see.","8389":"As with all zoos some of the animals could not be seen as they would either be inside resting or just difficult to find, but we managed to see all the ones we were really looking forward to seeing (except the tiger which other visitors were seeing but we couldn't make it out).","8390":"The zoo map is very easy to read and helps you the plan your journey throughout the zoo.","8391":"It is not the largest zoo so there aren't very many large animals (like elephants, etc) but all this info can be found on the zoo website which is very well made and informative.","8392":"Would definitely recommend for a fun day out.","8393":"Visited here worried about the stereotypes of zoos not looking after animals properly but found this was totally not the case at Edinburgh zoo!","8394":"After reading the signs and going to the various talks around, it\u2019s obvious that the staff love these animals and that they prioritise the animals welfare over anything else and I think that\u2019s amazing.","8395":"It might mean you need to spend more time trying to spot the animals, but that\u2019s fine.","8396":"They also do amazing conservation work and it\u2019s great to know the ticket price is funding so many incredible projects!We went hoping to see different animals that we wouldn\u2019t get to see anywhere else","8397":"and we were not disappointed either.","8398":"Sun bears, cassowary, chimpanzees, rhinos and pigmy hippos to name a few!","8399":"The penguin enclosure is also very impressive.","8400":"I loved being able to immerse yourself with some of the \u2018walkthrough\u2019 enclosures, a personal highlight being the lemurs.","8401":"Staff were also lovely.","8402":"After twisting my ankle, I needed to call the mobility assistance vehicle to help get me to the top of the hill (which is free).","8403":"Our driver, Ruairidh, was very friendly and answered all our stupid questions as he drove us up.","8404":"The zoo is on a steep hill, but they do offer an assistance car if you need it, as I mentioned before.","8405":"Its quite a few years since my last visit but no elephants, no polar bears, no giraffe.","8406":"Not as young as I used to be so I do notice the steep hills more.","8407":"Some areas are not accessible by wheelchair (available for hire - \u00a310 refundable deposit) but there is a free shuttle bus on call that will take you up to the top and back if required; it was wet and cool and quiet when we were there and we still had to wait 20 minutes","8408":"so i guess longer at peak times","8409":"Went to zoo with kids all exited to see the animals.","8410":"Many areas empty and overgrown with no animals very poor overall experience.","8411":"Afraid won\u2019t be back.","8412":"When you pay they tell you it\u2019s a hilly site, they\u2019re not lying so if you have limited mobility beware.","8413":"I think we were a tad unlucky, many of the animals weren\u2019t out to see but having said that we did see the pandas, koalas and a tiger.","8414":"I would thoroughly recommend a visit to penguin rock with the emperor, rock hopper and gentoo penguins - they are so coooool!","8415":"I had to see this zoo because of the red panda's and the koala's and the giant panda's those are animals you don't see often in the zoo....","8416":"It might be an older zo bit they are busy with renovations and new enclosures.","8417":"I loved seeing those animals and the zoo is situated on the hillside so you also have a nice view now and then.","8418":"You do need to climb so you should wear good shoes and be able to do so.","8419":"I also loved that the lions were not shown because they recently had cubs...","8420":"Shows me that they are trying to take the best care possible for the animals.","8421":"First warning, the zoo is on the side of a steep hill and you start at the bottom, so be prepared for exercise.","8422":"There is a shuttle car to assist those who need it to the top.","8423":"We are fortunate to be in good health, so enjoyed the walk up and down the hill.","8424":"There were plenty of animals to see in enclosures that all seemed to be of a size to suit the animal.","8425":"The penguin pool is brilliant  with the birds almost walking and swimming amongst us.","8426":"Our timing coincided with the birth of the zoo's lion cubs, so access to the big cat area was restricted to stop the mother being distressed, but this didn't limit our enjoyment of the other animals.","8427":"Sadly, though, the giant pandas were not co-operating.","8428":"The female was being given quiet time and the male decided to hide away completely, so one of the main reasons for going to this zoo was not to be seen.","8429":"We did see the male red panda, which was a delight after going to many other zoos where the red pandas were as elusive as the giant pandas here.","8430":"You are able to walk among many of the animals, such as lemurs, wallabies and monkeys.","8431":"There is a wide choice of eateries, from full restaurant to snack bars.","8432":"The staff are very helpful and informative and keen to talk about their animals.","8433":"Edinburgh zoo is well worth the visit.","8434":"We visited with our little boy hoping to see lots of animals, the weather was great","8435":"so we were lucky.","8436":"On arrival- \u00a34 to park your car.","8437":"Absolutely extortionate, as once you\u2019re in that\u2019s it, you have to pay.","8438":"On arrival to buy tickets, there\u2019s a hidden fee that is voluntary.","8439":"Given the price of the tickets and the car parking charge we were unwilling to pay any extra.","8440":"The zoo itself if very hilly and the signposting isn\u2019t great.","8441":"Pandas behind Perspex screen which glares terribly so you can\u2019t actually see ok in the daylight!","8442":"Absolutely ridiculous.","8443":"The apes were amazing however, highlight for us.","8444":"All in all, we enjoyed it","8445":"but I wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s worth nearly \u00a320 pp.","8446":"Edinburgh is linked to other European zoos in it's animal conservation efforts.","8447":"In effect this means that zoos specialise in particular endangered species, and allows animals to be moved between zoos if there are suitable mates available given the age of the animal and it's genetics.","8448":"This is very much the way modern zoos operate, and has to be this way if critically endangered species are to survive.","8449":"Having said that it does mean that each zoo only has certain animals, and not the wide range that would have been on show previously.","8450":"Out main interest in great pandas, and we've been fortunate to see them worldwide.","8451":"We sponsor the pandas at Edinburgh, and as part of this get tickets for one annual visit ; although because we live 500 miles away, they are rarely used, and we sponsor the pandas for much wider reasons.","8452":"Edinburgh has 2 pandas, and to be frank, their \u201caccommodation\u201d in the past has appeared to be the worse\/smallest of any zoos we've seen worldwide.","8453":"Edinburgh zoo has now spend a lot of money on a new outdoor enclosure, and viewing area.","8454":"The outdoor enclose is great, but looked at from the visitors viewpoint the viewing area is disastrous.","8455":"Anyone involved with displaying anything behind protective glass will know that the light levels outside the viewing area have to be lower than those inside, otherwise reflection becomes a massive problem.","8456":"The new viewing area has low level lighting inside (suitable for the pandas), but daylight outside, rather than an enclosed area outside kept dark.","8457":"The results is that all you really see is your own reflection.","8458":"This is an incredible basic mistake, to say the least, and one that seriously detracts from one of the zoos main visitor attractions.","8459":"Cost 70 quid for 5 of us which isn\u2019t cheap however the place is big.","8460":"The animals looked well looked after and there was plenty of free seating and tables to eat, much better I\u2019m sure to take your own food I ate there which was very expensive and poor quality ... on a the plus side of things the staff were all lovely and the gift shop was reasonably priced ... def go bk","8461":"I really enjoyed the day.","8462":"The zoo is really nicely designed, the animals have lots of room and where makes and females are separate in the wild, they are kept the same way at the zoo!","8463":"The keepers are really friendly and knowledgeable and gave a lot of great talks throughout the day.","8464":"I'd recommend staying until late afternoon as a lot of the best views I got of animals were later on, possibly as the weather got cooler\/darker or maybe as fewer people were in the park then!","8465":"My favourites were the penguins, the pandas and the rhinos","8466":"First visit the pandas didn\u2019t want to come and say hello which was a shame as my friend only wanted to see them as she loves pandas.","8467":"Second visit with my partner and guess what , the pandas were out!Amazing seeing them.","8468":"Lots of other animals , my favourite are the monkeys and zebras.","8469":"We went into an indoor bit and saw the monkeys and they were very close and also we had a reptile talk in the same building were we got to hold a snake.","8470":"The place has lots to look at , friendly knowledgeable staff and enough places to grab food and also a picnic area.","8471":"We had the best time even if the hill nearly killed me .","8472":"The zoo itself is on a hill and there are a lot of steep bits so not great for those with any mobility issues.","8473":"For my husband","8474":"and I this wasn\u2019t an issue and we spent a good 3-4 hours here.","8475":"The animals look well cared for and the penguins are well worth a mention as we spent quite a while here watching them dive in and out of the water.","8476":"The lions were out of bound as there are new born cubs and are having privacy which is understandable.","8477":"I was able to see the tiger and he (I think) was sunbathing up high on his lookout.","8478":"We weren\u2019t so lucky with the pandas as one was inside and asleep and the other enclosure the inside was off bounds","8479":"and she was inside (probably as it was a windy day).","8480":"I\u2019ve read other reviews complaining about this","8481":"but I totally understood that it\u2019s the luck of the draw if they wanted to go outside.","8482":"The chimpanzee enclosure was very impressive and clearly not that old.","8483":"As you go in you can see some of them taking part in voluntary research which was different.","8484":"There were also a few walk through enclosures (wallaby\u2019s and monkeys) which mean you get up closer.","8485":"We didn\u2019t eat lunch in the cafes or restaurant as we looked and thought it was overpriced.","8486":"Recommended","8487":"We had a really great day at the zoo.","8488":"I have mobility problems and did find the amount of walking tiring but made use of the mobility vehicle which was really great (basically a guy you can phone to pick you up and drive you places).","8489":"If I was going to go again I would bring a packed lunch and I would avoid the weekend which was very busy with kids.","8490":"I would also have bought tickets online in advance because you get a discount :-)","8491":"I particularly came to Edinburgh to  See the Giant Pandas.","8492":"When we got to the Pandas there was none around to be seen.","8493":"We walked up to the panda section around four times and on the last time we caught a glimpse of the panda inside the room, laying down, the only downfall is that from this view it is pretty impossible to get a picture or to even see the panda properly as the glass tends to show your own reflection more.","8494":"The rest of the zoo was very average.","8495":"We were told there was no lions at this occasion, there was also no tigers and couldn\u2019t see the giant rhino either.","8496":"The penguins are really good, the sun bear and the meerkats also.","8497":"The zoo had a really friendly team from the get go, once we bought our tickets we were handed a map and she, wrote down times for when events and feeds were happening for specific animals and birds.","8498":"thought the entrance fee of \u00a317 50p a bit steep for senior citizens but we had hoped to see the giant panda unhappily all we got was a vague shape through a glass window,after a tiresome climb especial as my wife and i are both in our seventies.","8499":"We did have some nice views of some animals ie penguins,sun bear, pelicans,meercats etc but missed out on the lions as one was having cubs on the whole it was not worth the money especialyafter visiting the penguins cafe,this place is a total rip off.being in need of some light refreshment this seemed ideal to rest our bones and have a light snack, a pastie & cuppa each  was purchased we were astonished to be charged \u00a317 60p when asked how much the cheese pasties were we were told \u00a35 95p each!!!","8500":"For this price we could buy 8 greggs cheese pasties(tastier) and still have 70p change.","8501":"At least dick turpin wore a mask,This cafe should be banned from trading they are ,a an absolute disgrace AVOID AT ALL COSTS","8502":"Having spent over \u00a3150 to visit, Plus having traveled over 2 hours, it was a very poor experience.","8503":"Most of the enclosures were closed or had limited view.","8504":"We were told on arrival that the female panda was only viewable from the outside platform.","8505":"The tigers were also off view due to the cubs arrival.","8506":"There was no earring of animals having been moved from there enclosures so would not be viewable.","8507":"There was a lot of works going on around the site which meant other enclosures were unable to be viewed.","8508":"All Amenities other then the toilets were closed including the baby change area.","8509":"Having payed a full price ticket what we got to see was nothing.","8510":"A reduction in price would be thoughtful.","8511":"Or warning of all these changes would have meant we would have rearranged our visit for another time.","8512":"Lovely day at Edinburgh Zoo.","8513":"This was our second visit and thankfully we managed to see the pandas this time!","8514":"They were feeding, so were quite active munching away on their bamboo.","8515":"Saw lots of animals including lions,lemurs, sun bears, red pandas and penguins.","8516":"There's quite a lot to see and do and all the animals are quite spread out, which is nice because they have their own space.","8517":"It is quite a lot of walking and most of it is uphill or on steep slopes so wear something comfortable!Took a few hours to walk round, including a rest stop for lunch.","8518":"A nice day out, easy to access by bus from the city centre.","8519":"Finally got to see Edinburgh Zoo, awesome views from the Hilltop, layout is clean\/safe and well signposted.","8520":"Great playparks for kids.","8521":"Staff all so friendly helpful.","8522":"I used the free courtsey bus ride which took me up to Hilltop View point","8523":"and then i walked down at my leisure, the driver chatted about the zoo and animals and insight to new features coming 2020.","8524":"Id highly recommend doing the trip this way as the hill is very steep.","8525":"Food in cafe was lovely, good choice and reasonable prices.","8526":"Toilets were clean and kept well.","8527":"throughtout the zoo.","8528":"Was good that you could walk through some of the animal enclosures and get up close to them.","8529":"Really enjoyed the whole trip and look forward to returning in 2020.","8530":"Well, I don't know where to start really.","8531":"We had a few hours before we had to drive back home so we chose to go to the Zoo instead of the Castle...","8532":"We chose poorly.","8533":"Small inclosures for most of the animals, some pacing the walls back and forth, some were the plants were so overgrown, you couldn't see the Tiger anywhere, they might be good at hiding, but that was taking the Micheal a bit.","8534":"You can't go wrong with cute penguins, well, apart from the one lying face down on the rocks, separated from the others, looking rather sick or possibly dead as we didn't see it move for 10 minutes.","8535":"The lack of clean water in the pool area might be a cause as this looked like a young penguin as well.","8536":"Didn't see any of the Pandas, or the otters, or the Red Pandas either.","8537":"We saw more staff than animals.","8538":"At least we saw the Sunbears.","8539":"The cheeky part of this is a ticket for an adult is \u00a320 and they are using that money towards getting Giraffes!Maybe sort the zoo out first guys...","8540":"It's a dump!","8541":"We visited the zoo during the fringe festival it was a sunny day and the zoo wasn't overly busy.","8542":"We were able to see most of the animals but did not see the pandas (after trying throughout the day) which we were slightly disappointed about but they were in a new enclosure so was to be expected.","8543":"The only downsides to the zoo were that it's set on a hill and there were so many wasps around.","8544":"One set of bins was cordoned off it has so many around it!We would definitely recommend a visit when in Edinburgh.","8545":"Went yesterday as the weather was gorgeous for a change.","8546":"The zoo is set on a hill and is simply far too steep for anyone with any kind of mobility issues.","8547":"I don't have any but still found it a challenge!","8548":"As my husband is recovering from an op, we got the mobility vehicle to the vultures area as that was as far as they would take us.","8549":"It was still a steep hike to the pandas and then when we got there nothing to see.","8550":"A lot of the zoo seems pretty empty.","8551":"For \u00a340 I won't be going back again.","8552":"The parking is limited (only cash is accepted!)","8553":"and although we got a space as we turned up just after opening, there is also a fair hike to the entrance.","8554":"This was also poor.","8555":"Those without tickets got a quiet lane.","8556":"Those of us who had paid in advance got to stand in a queue rather than just be let through and there were many people barging in front of us who were members, which was quite disruptive.","8557":"Seems poorly organised and could have been so much easier and better.","8558":"Thank goodness it was reasonably quiet when we got there as I can't imagine how it would be in busy times.","8559":"Not worth the money - penguins were great, but we saw more lego animals than real animals.","8560":"Such a shame.","8561":"I had high hopes, but been to much better and much more accessible zoos than this one.","8562":"I have wanted to go to this Zoo ever since I saw the Giant Pandas arriving at Edinburgh a while back.","8563":"I booked an online ticket which came to \u00a317.95.","8564":"As I live so far away, I decided to go by plane which was only a flight of about an hour.","8565":"Got the Airlink 100 which took me straight near the Zoo from the airport.","8566":"The Zoo has lockers and you get charged depending on the size of the suitcase as I had a medium case, it came to \u00a35 which I thought was reasonable.","8567":"It rained for half the day but there was plenty of places to get out of the rain.","8568":"The positives of my visit was that I had a lovely pizza at one of the restaurants with an Apple Juice which came to under \u00a312 which was delicious, the staff were lovely.","8569":"The Zoo staff were friendly and gave tips of when they thought the animals would be more active.","8570":"I really enjoyed the area where the Penguins were, it was so nice and liked the penguin parade where the penguins walk out of their cage a short distance and then return back inside, it was really funny to look at.","8571":"The lemur walk through was fun and seeing them jumping around, the same with the Spider Monkeys, Capuchin Monkeys and the Chimpanzees.","8572":"Also, another walk through with the Kangaroos and Wallabys'.","8573":"I did see the male Panda but he was asleep","8574":"but I was glad just to see him as I had spent a few hours not seeing him outside.","8575":"Luckily the inside viewing area was opened so I got to see him.","8576":"The same with the Koalas they were sleeping and were hiding.","8577":"The negatives, although I realise there is a chance you take when you go to the Zoo that you won't see some animals which I didn't see mentioned in the leaflet.","8578":"The monkey walk through was disappointing as there was no monkeys in there.","8579":"I also expected that I would get the locker fee back as I thought the fee was a form of security that would be given back when I emptied the locker and returned the key but no.","8580":"I still enjoyed the day and though the lego structures were amazing.","8581":"Was well worth the visit.","8582":"Really glad we decided to get shuttle bus to the top of the zoo on entering, still steep parts, but able to work down the hill visiting all the animals.","8583":"Wouldnt of wanted to start at the bottom by entrance & climb up all that way!","8584":"Wonderful experience for all ages.","8585":"We went especially for the penguin exhibit and parade.","8586":"Staff talks were engaging and informative.","8587":"We were on a short trip to Edinburgh and wanted to see the Pandas at Edinburgh Zoo.","8588":"We saw quite a lot of the animals.","8589":"We did see the Male Panda in its indoor enclosure which was good to see.","8590":"The only negative feedback is that it is hard to get good photos as the glass is very reflective and unless you have a good reach it is hard to get close to the glass to get better pictures.","8591":"It was still good to get a glimpse of him.","8592":"The weather was very kind to us so we could see most things.","8593":"A number of the eating places were closed so getting food there was restrictive.","8594":"The Lego models were also very good.","8595":"All in all a good visit and worth going.","8596":"I always try to visit the local zoo to where I am visiting.","8597":"This place did not open on time, and no reason given as to why.","8598":"There was a lot of lego structures.","8599":"It seemed quite run down to me.","8600":"There was only one tiger, and was told at the tiger talk that you could not see the Lions.","8601":"Some of the food areas were closed, so bring a picnic\/snacks.","8602":"I went  in to feed the lorikeets, there was a woman selling the feed for \u00a31, but suggested we did not buy it, as they was not eating, which they was on both occasions I went into this section.","8603":"I went to the penguin parade early to get a good spot, but there was no direction of where to stand until a few minutes before the talk\/parade.","8604":"Hundreds of people lined the walkway for the parade, and people were told to stand otherwise they could get a beak in their face, we waited for some time, and 2, yes 2 penguins were on this \"parade\".","8605":"A lot of enclosures closed early, with no mention of this at the entrance.","8606":"Edinburgh zoo did not disappoint, all the animals were lovely to visit, but the main Joy, was Joyce.","8607":"Me and 2 of my friends visited Edinburgh for the first time and met Joyce the volunteer at the Panda enclosure at the start of our day and from then on kept bumping into Joyce who kept providing us with nuggets of info, and many laughs.","8608":"She was so helpful to not just us, but every individual we seen her with.","8609":"The zoo was brillant but honestly Joyce was an absolute pleasure to be around and I am very glad to say I met her.","8610":"I will tell people to visit  Edinburgh Zoo on the reccomendation that they look out for Joyce.","8611":"Thank you for sharing your kindnes Joyce, it won't be forgotten.","8612":"Never change.","8613":"I I hope this finds its way back to you.","8614":"A huge let down to what this zoo used to be.","8615":"Way over priced with hardly a fraction of the animals we were expecting to see.","8616":"A total rip off and it should be ashamed to call it's self the best zoo in Scotland.","8617":"I was visiting Edinburgh for the first time in years and hadn't been since I was young.","8618":"The zoo was not great.","8619":"Apart from the penguins it seemed most animals had gone missing!","8620":"As most enclosures had 1 animal if any.","8621":"I feel like you are almost paying the admissions price for hill walking with potential animal spotting, sadly.","8622":"The tiger enclosure for example had all these plagues of the different breeds... there was 1 on show.","8623":"If I hadn't went as a couple it would have been 1 star, the fact it was as a couple gave it 2 stars as walking about together etc can make it a nicer day out.","8624":"Feel like they should inform you about animals not being in their enclosures perhaps before entering?","8625":"As it is a zoo after all.","8626":"Can't say I'll be going back.","8627":"Went to the zoo mainly to see the Pandas, which we didn't,they spent all day indoors (i know it was all day because i checked on the web cam) Zoo not very good for those with mobility problems or unfit (very steep) hghlight of the visit was the lego exhibits and walk of the penguins,sorry wouldnt go again ad cant recommend","8628":"Visited for first time and loved it.","8629":"We took a tram from Princess Street to Balgreen it\u2019s about a 3\/4 mile walk from tram stop.","8630":"The zoo is great although very hilly.","8631":"We particularly enjoyed animal antics show, the monkeys (very cheeky) and the hippo (very snotty).We watched the penguin parade, played at the park and had a lovely ice cream.","8632":"We booked tickets in advance which saved quite a bit.","8633":"Worth a visit","8634":"When I had my little girl and was on maternity leave, we decided to get a joint membership.","8635":"Best thing we have ever done.","8636":"She is now almost and as you can imagine a whole day is a bit much for her so having the membership pass means we can go until she is tired and we haven\u2019t paid a fortune to only be there a few hours.","8637":"Today we went and it rained the whole time we were there.","8638":"Nothing waterproofs and wellies couldn\u2019t handle and we still had the best time!I\u2019ve seen a few reviews about not seeing the animals out and about.","8639":"I actually like the thought that the animals have a choice whether they are on parade or not.","8640":"I understand people pay money to go to the zoo but also animal rights have to be thought about surely?","8641":"Pandas have been moved to ensure their quality of life away from noisy construction.","8642":"If you allow a full days visit then your sure to see the animals you just have to be patient.","8643":"I\u2019ve noticed on sunny days most animals tend to be out and about more!The zoo is on a hill so be prepared to hike the hills but it\u2019s worth it!We just under \u00a39 a month direct debit for our membership so doesn\u2019t break the bank and as my little girl loves it, we plan on keeping Our memberships for a good few years.","8644":"With memberships you get access to highland wildlife Centres and other  zoos.","8645":"We plan on visiting Chester this October (one free entry per year)","8646":"We visited on Sunday and had a lovely day.","8647":"A very enjoyable way to spend a sunny afternoon in the city.","8648":"We visited on a Saturday and booked our tickets in advance which saved around \u00a33 per head.","8649":"We were disappointed that the entry queue for pre-bookings was longer than the queue for people turning up on the day.","8650":"We were given a map at reception which was quite small and found the signage around the site not very helpful.","8651":"The zoo is on a hill and there are some very steep climbs which anyone with walking difficulties would find hard to manage.","8652":"Our main reason for visiting was for our grandson to see the giant pandas and unfortunately we'd booked at a time when the indoor viewing area was closed.","8653":"We visited the outdoor viewing area twice with no luck, but fortunately we made one last visit and one of the pandas kept coming out, walking around and then going back inside.","8654":"Our favourites were the sun bears, red pandas and the penguins.","8655":"We could have spent all afternoon just watching the penguins chasing each other around the pool and jumping out of the water.","8656":"We had a snack at one of the caf\u00e9s and found the coffees very expensive especially when they were served in paper cups.","8657":"We spent 6 hours at the zoo, so got our money's worth.","8658":"Very expensive for very little were told the lions had cubs so were not on show many other enclosure were empty not much on show.","8659":"The place is not well kept the enclosures were unkempt there was a bad smell, from some.","8660":"The animals that were on show looked bored and unhappy.","8661":"Penguins were the best.","8662":"I have to say not worth your money.","8663":"Went to a zoo in England and was delighted with the amazing choice.","8664":"I hope Edinburgh makes improvements until then we will not be back.","8665":"Visited the zoo.","8666":"At reception was  told the lions weren't on show as they had just had cubs other zoo I have visited have had cameras on a screen  showing the cubs for public to see.","8667":"Hardly no animals on show.","8668":"Best bit about this zoo is penquin rock amazing area these gorgeous animalsDef won't be recommending this zoo. .","8669":"Our little family have bought the years pass.","8670":"It has been money well spent.","8671":"This year so far we have been 5 times and the kids love it.","8672":"It's so peaceful to be able to have a walk around and see the animals.","8673":"There is always spots to sit down and have our picnic.","8674":"Brilliant tool to educate our children.","8675":"One of our kids is autistic and there is loads for him to do.","8676":"The staff have always been very understanding and patient with him.","8677":"We will definitely be renewing our membership next year","8678":"I had the best day ever here.","8679":"We was literally here from the moment it opened till closing.","8680":"I enjoyed how you could get up close to the animals and join in a little bit.","8681":"We seen the panda, which was great as we were told we might not.","8682":"We did the penguin parade-","8683":"my fave part watching all the little penguins walk round the zoo.","8684":"I also loved feeding the birds, and watching one poo on my partner.","8685":"The funniest thing ever.","8686":"The knowledge about the animals from the staff was amazing.","8687":"This zoo was perfect and we was a family of adults.","8688":"Kids would love it if they went, so much for them to do.","8689":"Definitely go back again!","8690":"As we live close by the zoo we have a membership and a parking pass.","8691":"If you go at least 3 times in a year that pays for the membership and the parking pass is \u00a310 for the year.","8692":"This used to be an old fashioned zoo but it is now more into conservation than a zoo.","8693":"Today they announced 3 endangered asiatic lion cubs had been born.","8694":"The rhinos are youngsters that are kept there until they are old enough to breed then they are moved to another zoo for breeding.","8695":"Sometimes it can be hard to see some of the animals as enclosures are kept as natural for the animals as possible.","8696":"Lately they have done a bricklive demonstration with models throughout the zoo made from lego.","8697":"They also had a lego pit for children to play in.","8698":"Even though it can be expensive to get in it is worth it for a full day out","8699":"Quite reasonably priced entrance fee but steer clear of the cafe\/shop it\u2019s very expensive.","8700":"A few of the exhibits weren\u2019t on show because of maintenance which was disappointing .","8701":"Take your hiking boots with you there\u2019s quite a steep climb to see the pandas which incidentally fail to make an appearance.","8702":"All in all a decent day out.","8703":"This was our second visit ever; if I tell you at this point that I\u2019m not keen on zoos in general, it should give you an idea how good it is.","8704":"All the animals look well looked after and there\u2019s none of what a zoo-hater would expect to see, pacing or banging their feet on the floor, etc.","8705":"And if you remember that nearly everything there is endangered and part of a breeding programme, it\u2019s a great opportunity to see some of these rare species in a nice environment.","8706":"All the talks are really interesting and engaging and all the staff and keepers seemed really enthused about the animals they care for.","8707":"I also really liked the fact that almost every talk had a little \u2018save the planet\u2019 vibe on the end of it without ramming it down your throats or making you feel bad about it; just bit-sized helpful hints you can do at home.","8708":"I recommend our plan of action, which was to fly around doing all the talks and sessions and then go back to see any of your favourites again later.","8709":"We had our list of must-sees but frankly everything in this zoo is fascinating - especially the ones you\u2019d never heard of before.","8710":"I do highly recommend feeding the Rainbow Lorikeets, or even just taking a stroll in their enclosure.","8711":"And obviously, go to the Penguin Parade because it\u2019s Edinburgh zoo, why would you not?!The Head Keeper (at least I think that\u2019s his job)","8712":"Barry is incredibly knowledgable about each and every animal you come across in the zoo.","8713":"He\u2019s present at nearly all of the talks, if he\u2019s not fully presenting them himself, and seems to be able to read minds because whenever a question formed in my head, he\u2019d answer it in his next sentence.","8714":"He\u2019s also super helpful, friendly and will quite happily guide you from talk to talk, stopping off to give impromptu tit-bits on whatever animal you\u2019re passing along the way.","8715":"We practically got a personal tour of the entire zoo!!!The price of entry is very reasonable for what you\u2019re getting, especially if you attend the talks and handling sessions, etc.","8716":"And it all goes to the zoo itself, so everyone\u2019s a winner.","8717":"The only food open during our visit was the penguin cafe, purely because we weren\u2019t there in peak season, but the food here was really nice, if a little pricey.","8718":"I\u2019d recommend going for lunch at an obscure time though because there isn\u2019t much sitting space in the cafe.","8719":"Access wise, the whole place is built on a hill, which is pretty steep in places.","8720":"There\u2019s very few steps, but it still might be tricky in places if you\u2019re less able on your feet; wheelchairs would get around alright","8721":"but you might have to plan a route to avoid steeper paths.","8722":"For context - my boyfriend recently had chest surgery before our visit, so wasn\u2019t exactly in peak condition and had to stop for a rest every half hour or so; there\u2019s a million benches and spots around where you can stop for a rest, especially towards the bottom end of the complex.","8723":"And finally the toilets; considering they\u2019re toilets for a mostly outdoor facility, they were actually really clean.","8724":"Overall, for someone who doesn\u2019t like zoos, this place is amazing: all the staff are wonderful, the animals couldn\u2019t be in better hands and you learn a ridiculous amount.","8725":"And even if you don\u2019t want to learn, there\u2019s chimps, bears and a murder bird for you to marvel at (Cassowary...trust me).We\u2019ll definitely be back for a third visit at some point in the future.","8726":"This was a planned trip for my sisters 60th Birthday to see the King Penguins, 4 sisters on an overnight stay in Edinburgh.","8727":"On arrival we were told that the Lions were mating and so we could not see them.","8728":"The Pandas had a vet attending so could not see them.","8729":"As we went round the zoo there were very few animals visible and a lot of signs on areas saying no animals.","8730":"The zoo appeared run down and unkempt.","8731":"The only positive was the penguins.","8732":"I visited Yorkshire Wildlife Park last week which you left feeling totally invigorated and inspired.","8733":"This was a special trip and we felt let down by our experience.","8734":"Very expensive, not worth the entrance fee.","8735":"They recommend 6hrs to spend there we dragged it out to 1.5hrs.","8736":"they slap a conservation  donation on the price too so be aware of that too.your money would be better spent on other attractions around Edinburgh.","8737":"Absolutely loved the zoo.","8738":"Probably one of the best I\u2019ve been too.","8739":"Was sad the koala part was closed, that\u2019s understandable as one was unwell.","8740":"Visited the zoo late August without doing any research, decided on the spur of the moment to go during a long weekend trip to Edinburgh.","8741":"Very disappointed, no tigers, lions or pandas to be seen.","8742":"Not impressed by the general state of the animal enclosures, animals we did see looked bored \/ sad.","8743":"First visit to a zoo in many years, not to be repeated.","8744":"The zoo is located on the side of a hill and is hard work walking around between enclosures.","8745":"I read the recent reviews, didn't believe them and went anyway.","8746":"Visiting Edinburgh with a young child it seemed like the obvious place to go.","8747":"Really was poor though, even the staff shuffling around looked disappointed and a little embarrassed to be there.","8748":"It felt like the first visit of the film to Jurassic Park where the characters were treated to three 'no-shows' and a sick triceratops.","8749":"Thankfully our visit didn't descend into a life or death run from the exhibits but that may have added some entertainment at least.","8750":"Well what can I say apart from this was one of the worst days out I\u2019ve had.","8751":"As a good rangers man I went hoping to see a few fellow bears but was left bitterly disappointed when there was none on show!","8752":"The general cleanliness of the place falls well below expectations, the state of some of the cages were an absolute disgrace!","8753":"Several of the animals I was looking forward to seeing weren\u2019t even there despite being advertised!","8754":"Far too many of the staff looked totally disinterested and one even made a smart remark to myself as I had my Gers top on","8755":"and I can only assume he\u2019s a supporter of the mhanky mob!!","8756":"Total waste of time.","8757":"Avoid at all costs and definitely Ger friendly!!","8758":"Watp","8759":"We travelled from Newcastle for the day specifically for our child\u2019s birthday as they love animals and thought this would be a really special trip... wrong!We barely seen any animals.","8760":"I appreciate \u2018mating season\u2019 is a time of year in which they close sections of the zoo or keep animals away from the public but I think this should be reflected in the price or made clear on the website.","8761":"There were loads of enclosures completely empty or animals no where to be seen.","8762":"Again appreciate animals sleep but it\u2019s very disappointing to go to a zoo and not to be able to see animals, most the ones we did see (other than the penguins which were great!)","8763":"were sound sleeping.","8764":"I feel there should be a bit more going on throughout the zoo in the vent of the above so at least there is more going on.","8765":"Play parks were ok nothing amazing and completely full and hectic probably due to the lack of entertainment within the animal enclosures!!!","8766":"There was a Lego display there but not suitable for a toddler.","8767":"Left after under 2 hours and even that was dragged out as long as possible.","8768":"Also we didn\u2019t quite understand why the zoo use posters with giraffes on when there aren\u2019t any giraffes there?!","8769":"just something else which disappointed our little one as she thought by seeing them on the signs\/posters they were there!These are my opinions on this occasion.","8770":"We have been years ago when we did actually see more of the animals and had a better trip.","8771":"This was sadly very disappointing and for us a complete waste of time and money.","8772":"Based on this we will not be returning to this zoo unfortunately...","8773":"So, short story, my 7 year old son is obsessed with pandas, and has been for about 5 years, so this trip was primarily for him to see the giant pandas.","8774":"However, we all had a fantastic time.","8775":"We fed the rainbow lorikeets and got to walk through the wallabies and lemurs.","8776":"Both of my kids as well as myself and hubby loved every minute we spent in the zoo, and are definitely visiting again in the future.","8777":"Most of the animals were not available for viewing which was disappointing.","8778":"We only stayed around 2 hours.","8779":"The cost of food in there is extortionate.","8780":"A bottle of water was \u00a32.25 too.","8781":"The kids enjoyed what they got to see.","8782":"I\u2019ve been going for years and always loved it but this year it wasn\u2019t as good.","8783":"Quite a lot to see and do at the zoo.","8784":"I don\u2019t know why people have been so negative.","8785":"Yes, it\u2019s steep","8786":"but they do warn you about that when you arrive.","8787":"Yes, some enclosures are overgrown but as far as I am aware, animals in the wild don\u2019t live on manicured lawns or topiary trees","8788":"so I am sure they prefer this kind of habitat.","8789":"Staff friendly and helpful.","8790":"Cafe lots of choice and reasonably priced.","8791":"Aim for lunchtime for the pandas as the staff are apparently trying to get the male into a routine to eat around 12-2 ish outside.","8792":"Koalas are definitely worth a visit, very cute!I hate to see animals in captivity but as the aim is conservation I\u2019m happy to support the zoo.","8793":"Lots of empty spaces and closed off sections.","8794":"Several of the catering amenities closed early and we had to search around to get a drink.","8795":"Another of those places where they charge for parking on top of a high entrance fee.","8796":"They should visit Chester and see how to run a proper zoo.","8797":"Totally disappointed in this place at \u00a344 for 2adults didnt get to see lions tigers rhino chimps or panda....seen more at tweddle farm a petting zoo in northeast england...","8798":"Lots of people walking around and you heard the same conversations (complaining about not seeing the big animals) lots of the lets say boring smaller animals but we will not be rushing back.... amenities food and loos where grubby at best","8799":"Parked up \u00a34 parking not to bad, \u00a321.95 to get in, bit steep, but I wanted to see pandas as I\u2019ve not seen pandas.","8800":"The lady at the ticket desk said sorry mating season for the lions so there not on display.","8801":"Ok no problem I\u2019ll see the elephants giraffes gorillas cheetahs kangaroos camels ponies horses, petting zoo.","8802":"The usual.","8803":"Oh not here the usual...... in fact, none of the above.","8804":"There are pandas apparently but there out the back as she is pregnant and they don\u2019t want her to miscarry.","8805":"What about him the crowd ask?","8806":"The zoo is on the side of a mountain, and not for the disabled, there is a mini bus, in fact a very small mini bus which takes up 4 adults and 4 children, a car for wheel chair passengers, that sits idle waiting for some one, the mini bus takes 20 minutes to come back.","8807":"So basically everyone gives up.","8808":"On an up side the hippos and penguins are great; so are the meerkats koala and brown bears.","8809":"Not enough toilets.","8810":"The shop has a lot of stuff in it, nice stuff","8811":"but some of it is so expensive, it\u2019s unreal.","8812":"Small packets of sweets \u00a32.25 you can get large packets of the same sweets for a \u00a31 so really not worth it.","8813":"Rock one type, \u00a32.25 these are standard things mums usually buy for kids, or to take back for others.","8814":"Instead of selling one here and there, go for less expensive and sell by the dozen, makes sense.","8815":"I bought a couple of bracelets which were very good value so mixed up.","8816":"First time ever I\u2019ve not been to a zoo and gone home with bags full of stuff.","8817":"Take a pack lunch if you don\u2019t want to choke on there prices for food and snacks.","8818":"In Great Yarmouth they do a bucket and spade with slush filled in so can image the size for \u00a31.99 a so called large in a disposable cup \u00a34.99 at the zoo.","8819":"Don\u2019t know who is running the costings budgeting but they have it all wrong","8820":"There have been a number of negative reviews recently, but you have got to remember that this is a zoo and animals can't be forced into making an appearance.","8821":"At the date of visit, the lions area was closed as was the panda indoor walkthrough, both due to it being breeding season, but we were informed about that.","8822":"Disappointing,  but there are lots of other animals to see.","8823":"The sun bears were a first for me","8824":"and i don't think i have ever been so close to a monkey than we were in the link centre and the monkey walkthrough.","8825":"Some animals were out and some were in but on the whole there were enough animals to see, including one sleepy tiger.","8826":"Penguins never disappoint!The zoo is on a hill and some of the paths are steep.","8827":"They have put the premier animals (panda and lions) up near the top so be prepared for a fitness work out, though assistance is available if needed.","8828":"There are several walkthrough areas which allow you to get up close and the viewing areas on the whole are good.","8829":"It looks like they are expanding which hopefully will give some of the larger animals (e.g. rhinos) more room.","8830":"Overall we spent around 5 hours there and probably still missed some of the animals due to the layout as there is no real circuit route.","8831":"A good zoo with more potential.","8832":"Worth a visit, especially if you get to see the pandas, which unfortunately we didn't.","8833":"We came to Edinburgh for the weekend as a treat before going back to school next week and decided to incorporate a visit to the zoo,  we were so disappointed.","8834":"It was relatively quiet so looking into the enclosures was easy HOWEVER we barely saw anything,  we went through the primate walkway - nothing,  lemur walkway  - nothing,  the lion enclosure was shut,  the  indoor panda enclosure was closed, and it didn't come outside.","8835":"We did see the koalas and penguins though that were cute.","8836":"There were plenty of empty enclosures,  lots of signs saying areas were shut, we managed a couple of hours before leaving disheartened.","8837":"One positive though was the lego sculptures that are currently on display.","8838":"Edinburgh zoo is around 3 miles from the centre and is on a hill.","8839":"The zoo does host a few exotic animals such as Giant Panda and Koalas which are quite rare.","8840":"The Panda enclosure is at the end and on the top of a hill.","8841":"The staff do check if you need any assistance for the same.","8842":"Pandas were recently relocated to the new enclosure and we had to wait a good 45 minutes to get a glimpse of Yang Guang, the Male Panda.","8843":"That was definitely worth the wait.","8844":"Koalas are another major attraction.","8845":"Please be aware that this  enclosure closes early than others.","8846":"Penguins are definitely the stars of the zoo.","8847":"It's a delight to watch them.","8848":"Do not miss the penguin rock.","8849":"It's a must visit within the zoo.","8850":"Except for the uphill walk this is definitely a wonderful day out.","8851":"Ignore the negative reviews.","8852":"It's a good zoo on a hill.","8853":"There is assistance if you ask.","8854":"We found the walk to be manageable.","8855":"We saw lots of animals including koalas.","8856":"Edinburgh Zoo is situated on a hillside, so plenty of climbs, some steep and others not so.","8857":"However the park offers a free taxi run for those less manageable, so as not to miss the animals at the top of the park \ud83d\udc05 \ud83e\udd81 particularly the only Pandas \ud83d\udc3c in Britain.","8858":"There are lots to do for the young.","8859":"I only wish I was 30 years younger \ud83d\ude02.","8860":"My favourite attraction has to be the penguins \ud83d\udc27  \ud83d\udc27 .","8861":"Spectacular sight to watch them being fed.","8862":"Recommended for a family day out and reasonable priced too.","8863":"Superb.","8864":"The talks witty and informative, animal antics unmissable.","8865":"Fallen for the rhinosWent for the pandas ,am going back for the zoo","8866":"Arrived at the zoo having bought pre-booked tickets it took forever to get in as there was only 1 person on the desk.","8867":"We saw hardly any of the animals as the enclosures were overgrown and the viewing areas didn\u2019t give very good views.","8868":"We weren\u2019t advised prior to booking that that Lions\/ Pandas were mating and enclosures were closed off as were many of the paths.","8869":"The poor tiger looked like it has simply had enough poor thing.","8870":"Really wasn\u2019t worth the money and the slog up the hill to see very little.","8871":"This was my 1st visit to the Zoo in a good few years and was excited to show my children the Zoo I once adored visiting.","8872":"We had a lovely day out as a family however my husband","8873":"and I couldn't help feeling a bit disappointed especially for the children who wanted to see the animals.","8874":"The Zoo itself is looking a bit tired, public areas such as restaurants and toilets were grubby and there were many empty and overgrown enclosures.","8875":"The tropical birdhouse had a handful of birds at best to see.","8876":"Both the pandas and lions closed.","8877":"We made the most of our visit however we won't be returning till things improve as it deffinetly did not provide value for money.","8878":"Having previously visited Blackpool zoo we were really looking forward to visiting Edinburgh zoo only to find it was not a patch on Blackpool.","8879":"Most of the viewing cages are overgrown with vegetation making it nearly impossible to see the animals.","8880":"We were especially looking forward to seeing the Chimps but the viewing area is totally unsuited to actually see anything - a keeper was supposed to give a talk but never turned up.","8881":"We did see the tiger fortunately as it was in its house, if it had been in the overgrown enclosure you would never have been able to see it.","8882":"The highlights for us were watching the mice in one of the monkey houses (never saw a monkey in the house but plenty of mice) and a poor badger was running around the area scared out of it wits.","8883":"Maybe the management would do well to visit other zoos to see how improvements could be made.","8884":"Opted for an online family ticket at just under \u00a350 for our group of four.","8885":"From city centre about \u00a310 uber fare but alot if buses go this route.","8886":"Sole reason to visit was I have never seen a panda and this is the only zoo in uk that has them.","8887":"Next nearest I think Berlin.","8888":"On arrival staff guide overbooked or on the door visitors to reduce queuing which meant we were able to have ours scanned and walk right in.","8889":"Immediately I noticed how tough navigating the zoo would be as its located on a hill.","8890":"Alot of time spent going up and down as their is no logical route that enables you not to miss an enclosure.","8891":"Maybe coloured routes or guidance on how to tackle a route.","8892":"Lions are breeding so no access at all inside or out.","8893":"This was communicated at entrance so technically you still have option to change your plans if lions are important.","8894":"We were not told panda breeding too meaning only outside viewing as inside closed so as not to disturb.","8895":"Huge disappointed crowds because no pandas outside.","8896":"But please persevere.","8897":"We came by an hour later due to all the navigation issues and found panda out and moving.","8898":"So pleased the highlight for me of the day.","8899":"I also loved the koala and how close you can get.","8900":"We took a small picnic to reduce costs and just purchased icecream.","8901":"Lots of places to sit and use toilets.","8902":"On a very hot day we found going uphill a challenge.","8903":"Missed all the live talks as we were always in wrong part of zoo.","8904":"For me it's a 5 star because of the pandas and koalas and the weather made for a great full day out around 5 hours.","8905":"Clearly signposted, ample parking, able to use Chester Zoo membership for free access (remember to take renewal letter from Chester).","8906":"Lotttttttttts of fairly steep climbs to get to the top of the hill, ample seating on the way.","8907":"The zoo do offer support if required.","8908":"A few animals were out of bounds due to breading season restrictions.","8909":"Very different from Chester and Yorkshire wildlife park, but still a pleasing and necessary service.","8910":"Staff were helpful and readily contactable.","8911":"Great time at the zoo, amazing how close you can get to the monkeys.","8912":"Didn\u2019t get to see the pandas as they said it was breeding season.","8913":"Didn\u2019t get to see the lions either due to that reason.","8914":"Nonetheless it was still a great experience and would go again.","8915":"On the side of Corstophine Hill is the zoo.","8916":"Easily accessible by bus from the city centre.","8917":"The site is very steep but transport around the site is provided for those with mobility problems.","8918":"The penguins are lovely and are taken for a walk daily.","8919":"The zoo is home to two Giant Pandas and many other species including Chimpanzees and tigers.","8920":"Food and drink outlets cater for the humans.","8921":"Food views from the top of the site.","8922":"Quite disapointed for price we paid...","8923":"Shouldnt charge full price if so many viewing areas are closed.","8924":"Didnt see many animals even going back and forth.","8925":"The penguin area glass viewing area was filthy.","8926":"There were some positives..","8927":"We liked the monkey area and the interactive reptile talk where we got to hold a snake.","8928":"We also enjoyed the giant lego displays.","8929":"The zoo overall was lacking some TLC and animals.","8930":"We had the opportunity to visit the zoo in late August and at arrived at around 4pm.","8931":"I assumed at that time with a couple of hours remaining, that the admission would be reduced especially as at the payment desk the lady advised a number of attractions were closed for the day.","8932":"No such luck - the entrance fee was exactly the same price and it was made clear it was 'our decision to pay to come in or not!'","8933":"We really wanted to see the Panda's (The inside viewing area was closed but outside areas were open) so we payed in....","8934":"No Panda's were spotted either at the outside viewing area or the internal web cam!","8935":"So where were they??","8936":"In fact walking around very few enclosures had any animals at all!","8937":"The icing on the cake for me was all the catering huts and main cafe were all closed up even though there was still a good hour of opening left?","8938":"Why was this?","8939":"The only thing remaining open was of course the gift shop on the way out!","8940":"A very disappointing experience - if they want to charge full price in the later afternoon then everything should still be open right up to 6pm or discount the entrance fee or have a last admission at 3pm time policy - all they want to do is take your money knowing you will see nothing and not get any refreshments!","8941":"It was the first time my son had been to a zoo and he found it amazing.","8942":"My wife is disabled but there is a FREE pick up\/drop off service anywhere in the zoo by calling the number given.","8943":"The friendly staff advised that we use the service straight away to go to the highest point, so that my wife could come down on the mobility scooter.","8944":"Lots of hills.","8945":"Animals looked very well cared for.","8946":"Some attractions closed due to \"mating season\" or areas being built (ready for introduction of Giraffes).A MASSIVE amount of penguins, and a \"penguin parade\", although only 2 went on the parade on the day we went.","8947":"I'm sure there are sometimes many more.","8948":"A really good spectacle.","8949":"We thoroughly enjoyed our day.","8950":"Could have stayed longer, but we had booked another attraction in the centre of the city so had to leave at 4pm.","8951":"Will definitly visit again when in the area.","8952":"If you are considering a visit to Edinburgh Zoo, do not waste your money.","8953":"We visited today and only got to see a couple of animals - most of them were sleeping or hiding.","8954":"When we complained, we were told just to keep walking about until the animals woke up - not really practical with elderly parents.","8955":"There are plenty of other things to visit in Edinburgh that won\u2019t disappoint.","8956":"Edinburgh Zoo  Average zooit is  not badbut not more   than goodfew animal to seesome were hiddeni did  not catch any showthere is no  many signs   to tell how  toexit","8957":"This zoo gets a five star rating for their conservation efforts alone.","8958":"I don't even mind that I didn't see the pandas (asides from on the little screen that the keeper had)...","8959":"The keeper at the panda exhibit was also really lovely.","8960":"The centre for the chimpanzees is one of the most impressive features, I loved watching the researchers interacting with the chimps.","8961":"The big one in particular was adorable.","8962":"It's lovely when zoos add that little bit extra.","8963":"Koalas, pygmy hippos and posing meerkats are also a big hit.","8964":"I got some great pictures and will be returning when we come back to Edinburgh, hopefully the pandas will be a little more active when we do, but hey, animals are animals.","8965":"We took our 7 month old baby to Edinburgh Zoo for the 1st time.","8966":"Although he slept most of the time, we enjoyed ourselves and he woke up in time to visit the penguins.","8967":"After we finished we decided to build a bear in the shop and Lois the shop assistant helped us, she explained that normally the children do it themselves but obviously our son is too little but she went out of her way to make him involved and let him pick his own heart for his teddy and still did all she normally would with other children (reading the scripts etc).we love how it comes with it's own certificate for him to look back on his first zoo trip.","8968":"We really enjoyed our day at the zoo, we were a little disappointed that the build a bear doesn't come with clothes as the shop doesn't sell them but other than that.","8969":"Excellent.","8970":"And thanks again lois for making our ending special xx","8971":"I think that Edinburgh Zoo is the best place to see .I have been a member of the Zoo for several years now and have been twice this Summer.","8972":"Once for the After Hours Event on Friday 26th July 2019.","8973":"They also had a Lego Exhibition on spread all over the Zoo of life size see creatures.","8974":"Really great.","8975":"Penguin Parade has been going for over 60 years.","8976":"Fun to watch .","8977":"Every day at 2.15pm.","8978":"Koalas are also the only ones in Britain.","8979":"Saw the Young Female Koala awake , which does not often happen, as the sleep a lot of the day.","8980":"Edinburgh Zoo is a really nice place to go to.","8981":"It\u2019s not dirty or smelly .","8982":"They have moved the Giant Pandas to a new part of the Zoo at the top which means they have more space and trees to climb.","8983":"We travelled a long way and spent a lot of money to get to the zoo as it was my husbands wish to see the pandas for his 30th.","8984":"We were so exhausted and disappointed as no sign of them.","8985":"We kept checking on webcam\/website and had no warning and then suddenly the indoor viewing area was shut.","8986":"So disappointed as this was supposed to be a special treat.","8987":"I understand that they are animals but what is the point of having them here and encouraging people to visit if you can\u2019t even catch a glimpse of them.","8988":"We don\u2019t have a lot of money or holiday and specifically saved to visit the zoo and pandas and didn\u2019t get a chance.","8989":"We walked 3 times up the hill and waited around for a couple of hours and nothing.","8990":"The rest of the zoo was extremely disappointing also as most enclosures seemed empty.","8991":"We did see a Tiger but was so motionless you had to check it was even breathing.","8992":"Disappointed the lions where shut also.","8993":"Never been to a zoo that has had so many none existent animals to see.","8994":"Really put a dampener on what should have been a special 30th treat for my husband after saving to come to Edinburgh as I couldn\u2019t really afford to take my husband to China!We understand the Tian Tian is closed off but couldn\u2019t you encourage Yang Guang to go outside, even for little bits through the day.","8995":"We heard an awful lot of people saying they were disappointed as they had travelled far.","8996":"I think that something could be done to surely better manage people being able to view the pandas.","8997":"At the end of the day we have paid to support the animals and ensure they are cared for.","8998":"My husband would have been happy to have seen the Panda for 2 minutes just to say he had seen one.","8999":"Considering you are the only zoo in UK that has Pandas!Going home very disappointed!","9000":"And paid out a lot of money to be disappointed.","9001":"A brilliant visit.... animals in spacious, well maintained areas with lots of information.","9002":"I agree with the animals not being forced into public view, they are allowed to have as natural a life as possible.","9003":"The keepers are friendly and knowledgeable and the staff I encountered were extremely helpful.","9004":"I could have watched the squirrel monkeys all day.","9005":"This zoo is fantastic.","9006":"We visited primarily to see the koalas and giant pandas.","9007":"Staff were very knowledgeable and helpful.","9008":"We spent all day here with a mass of animals to see.","9009":"All in all a fantastic day out and highly recommended.","9010":"This was a special gift for my daughter so travelled a long way to get here and the zoo disappointed from the start.","9011":"The zoo is looking very tired and grubby in a lot of places the restaurants in particular.","9012":"Many empty exhibits and no explanation as to why.","9013":"We were not able to see the lions or pandas as they are having some adult time but that's nature but disappointing.","9014":"Generally there isn't much there","9015":"and I think that if the pandas were not there many wouldn't bother visiting.","9016":"I think a lot of areas could do with an update.","9017":"And I have never paid to park in a zoo before either.","9018":"Very disappointed  .on arrival nearly burnt the clutch out trying to get parked in the car park.when paying informed that lions and tigers wernt on show because of breeding season...also giant pandas wernt available...????","9019":"Saw more wildlife driving through edinburgh than the actual zoo...wont be back..if you like wasps however this is the place to visit..our 7 year old grandaughter did enjoy the playpark.!!!!","9020":"We had a fab time here last Friday!","9021":"I desperately wanted to see the pandas but as the website said part of the enclosure was closed for mating season I'd tried to keep my expectations in check.","9022":"I was so delighted to see one sat happily munching outside for a fair while!","9023":"Also loved the koalas, zebras, penguins, and loads of types of monkeys, especially the capuchins which we saw SO close up.","9024":"Really enjoyed seeing a few animals being fed, and the chimpanzee talk.","9025":"Staff were friendly.","9026":"A few animals were hiding as is to be expected and the lions were closed for mating, but their welfare is the important thing, and we were told about the lions by staff and signs so can't complain.","9027":"Thought the admission price was fair, as so many animals need looking after!","9028":"We spent five or six hours here quite happily and would come again.","9029":"What a great day I had at the zoo!","9030":"Took 3 trip back and forth to see the pandas and saw them in the end!","9031":"A few trips to the kolas and lion too.","9032":"Kids like many children wanted to play in the lovely park next to the penguins for hours.","9033":"I love Chester zoo and made the long trip to see the panda and it was well worth it!Reading other reviews makes me concerned, if you are looking for a circus or to see animals doing cat walks in front of you please turn on the Tv.","9034":"But if you are looking for a nice relaxed day with plenty to do.and the chance of seeing animals acting like animals I suggest a visit \ud83d\ude0d","9035":"Big ticket prices.","9036":"Unhelpful staff.long distance between animalsThere were only 2 animals worth sering in my opinion  the giant pandas and the penguins .who","9037":"di there uwn march !","9038":"That's it  then worse.hour lied to by the staff.who tell you can have as long as y like to take horrid of the pandas.lets face it most off us have gone to see the pandas.only to be told u can only have 10 muns viewing timeIf ur a serious photographer.one might say tour having s laugh go to china.its just a bit nearer to the uk.its pretty disgustingDirty cages .woukdnt go back in a hurry and very steep","9039":"We visited recently with two of our young grandchildren as the school holidays were drawing to an end.","9040":"It\u2019s been a few years since we had visited the Zoo and my overwhelming view on this visit was the lack of animals!","9041":"I understand that Zoos are geared much more to conservation but the lack of big animals or monkeys was disappointing.","9042":"Those animals that were there seemed to be sleeping or hiding in the further most corner of their compound.","9043":"The monkey house was completely empty apart from two small monkeys.","9044":"As for the famous pandas they were nowhere to be seen despite a very large new area for them.","9045":"Our two grandchildren enjoyed the visit which is what it was all about.","9046":"We had hoped to eat our lunch outside but the wasps were particularly active and that might be something the Zoo needs to look at.","9047":"Had a fantastic day at the zoo.","9048":"My 13 year old daughter (asd) is so keen on animals and the zoo didn\u2019t disappoint.","9049":"Staff were very friendly and patient, happy to answer any questions she had.","9050":"We visited many of the talks during the day which enabled us to get a better look at some animals and find out more about them.","9051":"Hill was tough but we made it and so lovely to see the female panda out for her birthday.","9052":"We took a picnic and there was loads of places to have a picnic.","9053":"There were lots of wasps but signs up to warn kids round bins and they had out different kinds of bins with closing lids when the open bins were to bad for wasps.","9054":"Nice to see big enclosures focused on getting the habitat right for the animals.","9055":"Only thing could have wished for was a drinks kiosk at the top of the hill!","9056":"Animals???","9057":"What animals?","9058":"We managed to see 3 zebras, 1 parrot, a couple of monkeys, someFlamingos and penguins.","9059":"Many of the attractions were closed due to breading season even though we were told the pandas would be out, we couldn\u2019t even see them on live cam!!!","9060":"Goodness knows where the rest of the animals were hiding, the rhinos weren\u2019t in their houses or in the field.","9061":"I have to say it\u2019s the worst zoo I\u2019ve been to.","9062":"The whole family enjoyed the visit, the zoo is small enough to go round without the kids getting tired out.","9063":"Unfortunately the pandas were settling in to a new home so we didn\u2019t see them but we got to see the koalas, penguin parade, monkeys and a tiger amongst others.","9064":"There was also a Lego event on which the kids loved as they had loads of Lego sculptures and a Lego building area.","9065":"There were lots of picnic areas but we ate at the penguin cafe , the food was good and not too pricey.","9066":"A great family day out,","9067":"We had no idea the zoo was situated on a hill.","9068":"Got our exercise too!Friendly staff, nice and informative boards around the animal enclosures, spent a full day visiting animals with a toddler and a senior in our midst so the pace was a bit slow.","9069":"We particularly liked the many kinds of monkeys including sweet cuddly baby squirrel monkeys with their parents, the penguins and the zebras.","9070":"We enjoyed our meal at the Grasslands restaurant and the toddler especially loved the Lego activity and the meerkats.","9071":"There are sufficient facilities, we never had to look to long for a toilet or a place to change a diaper.","9072":"We were to late to see the koalas and the panda was shy so we didn't get to see much of him.","9073":"We visited on an exceptionally warm day with quite a crowd but all in all we had a fun time and left just before closing time.","9074":"Advise not going to this zoo as many of the animals were locked away out of sight, couldn\u2019t see most animals as enclosures were hidden with too much enrichment.","9075":"Most enclosures were not big enough for the animals or the enclosures with less animals had more room.","9076":"For the price of admission not worth going and they still ask for more money for you to donate.","9077":"You also have to park in a hotel car park with not much room.","9078":"Spent about 2 hours here going to each enclose and no animals were out.","9079":"Extremely disappointed with whole day and I will definitely not be visiting again.","9080":"Dear friends,We visited Scotland from Cyprus with our two children 8 and 10.We also took them there 5 years ago, but we wanted to take them again, since they wanted to see the panda's again.","9081":"We walked every inch of the zoo.","9082":"What a disappointment.","9083":"Hardly any animals there.","9084":"Never again, especially at them prices.","9085":"We visited at the beginning of August.","9086":"We  saw only one Panda and that was for a few minutes - can't go into the indoor viewing anymore which is a shame.","9087":"A lot of the animals were unavailable - it's a lot to pay to see such a poor selection - was a hot day and only one kiosk open for drinks despite several bring dotted around.","9088":"Had to use the Cafe for a selection.","9089":"Chester Zoo so much better","9090":"Was visiting edinburgh with my parents and older sister,none of them had ever been to the zoo and i wanted to take them as past experiences have been so good!My dad paid for all 5 of us (\u00a321.95each!) and to say it was a waste of money was an understatement, big enclosures like Pandas and Lions were closed due to breeding season and others were empty.","9091":"Was not worth the money and seen maybe half a dozen animals.","9092":"The chimps enclosure had faeces smeared all over the glass,other enclosures were dirty too.","9093":"Empty enclosures should have signs and they should think about lowering the price if not all are open","9094":"Not a huge fan of Zoos as such, but I had really wanted to see the pandas.","9095":"After treking all the way up to the top to see them they were a no show.","9096":"Not the zoo's fault, but as the zoo is trying to encourage mating the inside viewing area had also been closed of.","9097":"So probably the main feature the zoo promotes itself on gave nothing back to paying customers.","9098":"Not sure why, like other places, a live video stream of inside couldn't be shown on the outside TVs instead or repetitive stock footage video.","9099":"That would have been better than nothing and left less people disappointed.","9100":"Other enclosures seemed small for the animals inside, such as the rhinos and tiger.","9101":"But to be fair the one tiger I could see slept on a hammock and never moved.","9102":"The penguins were fun to watch and we went back to see them, the pandas and tiger twice.","9103":"(Pandas still hadn't emerged, tiger was still asleep)","9104":"The penguins enclosure is a bit of a lack luster concrete monstrosity.","9105":"The Lego models were good.","9106":"Went to the Jungle Food court and would not recommend.","9107":"Prices were horrendous and the food was awful.","9108":"Driest, most bland cheese savoury sandwich of ever had and wasn't short of the five pound mark.","9109":"Was overly staffed, who were therefore stood around talking and made you feel inconvenient for actually being there and interrupting their conversations to order food.","9110":"Sure they could have been doing useful stuff like sweeping the old chips off the floor.","9111":"Whilst it wasn't the worst day out I've had it was no where near as good as I envisioned it would be.","9112":"We love Edinburgh Zoo.","9113":"Sometimes not all the animals can be seen but thats because the staff dont force them to come out.","9114":"Its such a lovely place just to walk aroun Loads of fab staff so friendly and helpful.","9115":"AlsoFantastic face painters- best we have seen!","9116":"Always enjoy a trip to the zoo!","9117":"Good variety of animals and interesting keeper talks informing of palm oil farms impact.","9118":"Unfortunately didn\u2019t get to see the lions as they were breeding but understandable.","9119":"It was also great seeing some penguins going out for a walk past people.","9120":"Koala bears and the Tiger were favourites to see!!","9121":"Visited the zoo 20th August 2019.","9122":"Absolutely disgusted at the entry fee to see empty filthy enclosures and also the whole zoo was in a terrible disgusting state with litter.","9123":"The wallaby walk through was littered with droppings all over the paths.","9124":"I have never in my life encountered lions who are shy and prude and locked away from public viewing due to a sensitive time in the breeding process.","9125":"Don't waste your money visiting this half empty dump.","9126":"I wanted to redress some of the negative reviews left for the zoo.","9127":"Yes, some of the enclosures are overgrown.","9128":"I guess this is for the animals benefit, not yours.","9129":"Also, do you honestly expect them to mow the grass?!","9130":"The enclosures are large so the animals can roam around.","9131":"The zoo exists to help the animals not just for your amusement.","9132":"Also, yes it's hilly.","9133":"It's in Scotland so it's not a shocker and there is assistance available if you bother to ask.","9134":"OK we didn't see the panda","9135":"but we did see numerous other animals including the utterly gorgeaus koalas!","9136":"Had a great day out and returned to our hotel tired but happy.","9137":"Some people really do need to be realistic.","9138":"This zoo is a great day out.","9139":"Reading the reviews.","9140":"I wonder what zoo they were visiting.","9141":"On my recent visit I saw many different animals.","9142":"There is the lego bricks exhibitions ongoing at the moment.","9143":"All the keepers are friendly and knowledgeable.","9144":"We saw the animal antics show.","9145":"This ranged from a turkey vulture to a goat.","9146":"The zoo is involved in a lot of conservation work.","9147":"The penguin parade is voluntary, if the penguins don't want to come out they are not forced.","9148":"Likewise the zoo has natural habitats and the animals are free to do what they like.","9149":"This might mean you don't see an animal, that's not the zoos fault.","9150":"Yes it's steep to get to the top, normally the bus takes you right to the top.","9151":"At the moment they are building.","9152":"So many reviews are negative and have no valid reasons to be so.","9153":"My wife and myself took our 6 year old son to the zoo, to say we are deeply disappointed would be an understatement.","9154":"We found a lot of enclosures with no animals them, they appeared dirty and shabby.","9155":"We won\u2019t be in a hurry to return despite paying a lot of money the previous visit to become members!","9156":"Would definitely not recommend anyone to visit!!!","9157":"What a luxury to have this venue on our Doorstep.","9158":"Its a great family day out.","9159":"Plenty to see and do.","9160":"The membership is well worth it too and you also get a discount in the shops when presenting the Membership Card.","9161":"I think weve been 4 times in the last 2 months, and plan to come back another 4 too lol.","9162":"Spent a full day at the Zoo looking at the wide variety of animals to be seen there.","9163":"Was well pleased to see one of the Giant Panda\u2019s.","9164":"We visited the Zoo with our 7 and 2.5 year old this week.","9165":"We paid \u00a335 as we used an app to get discounted tickets.","9166":"I\u2019m not normally one for Zoos and we\u2019ve been very lucky to have seen animals in the wild in South Africa","9167":"but I have to say I loved this zoo!","9168":"The conversation efforts and work are brilliant and all the enclosures looked great.","9169":"Of course you won\u2019t see anything, they\u2019re animals and not trained to entertain the public.","9170":"The penguins do the parade out of choice, the pandas will go inside to the seclusion area when they\u2019ve had enough and the other animals all have areas to \u2018get away\u2019 when they don\u2019t want to be around people.","9171":"If you want to go to a zoo where the keepers love the animals, care for them and their comfort and safety is paramount go to Edinburgh Zoo.","9172":"However if you want to see animals behaving unnaturally and only doing things for a food reward etc then go elsewhere.","9173":"This Zoo is fab and does a great job!","9174":"Had the most wonderful day out with our three boys (ages 6, 9, and 11).","9175":"They have insisted I write a review and give the zoo \u2018all the stars\u2019.","9176":"We cannot understand all the recent 1 Star reviews - so far removed from our experience!We got to the zoo early (about 10am) and stayed until closing.","9177":"There is so much to see we could\u2019ve happily stayed longer.","9178":"In total we saw just over 50 different species!","9179":"Including Koalas, Sun Bears, Rhinos, Pygmy Hippos, Zebra, and Penguins.","9180":"There are lots of talks on throughout the day which we found really interesting to listen to.","9181":"The boys were also able to handle Cockroaches and Stick Insects at the \u2018meet the insects\u2019 talk.","9182":"The zookeepers are all very knowledgeable and happy to talk and answer questions.","9183":"I loved the Rainbow Lorikeets, so beautiful.","9184":"You can also feed them nectar from a little cup.","9185":"All the different pigeons were fascinating and amazing to see.","9186":"The Pelicans were awesome!The \u2018wee beasties\u2019 hut was a favourite with the boys.","9187":"We got to see blue poison arrow frogs and an Axolotl which my son found very exciting as he has read much about them but not seen one before.","9188":"The boys spent about 30 minutes mesmerised by Brad the Chameleon.","9189":"He was adorable.","9190":"We took a picnic and ate it in a lovely picnic area right at the top of the zoo.","9191":"We didn\u2019t have any issues with wasps (although signage around bin areas suggests there has been a wasp issue).","9192":"Yes, the zoo is on a hill, but it really isn\u2019t as steep as some reviews suggest.","9193":"I was really worried about it after reading some reviews as I have joint problems, but it really wasn\u2019t an issue at all.","9194":"I found it an enjoyable walk up to the top (if you keep running up and down the hill to try and see the Pandas you probably will get tired out).The zoo didn\u2019t appear overgrown to us.","9195":"We like that areas have been deliberately left for native plants and insects to conserve biodiversity.","9196":"The boys liked that the enclosures had plenty of foliage for the animals to hide amongst if they didn\u2019t want to be seen.","9197":"We knew before we went that we were unlikely to see the Pandas as their indoor viewing area is closed.","9198":"We also knew the Lions were closed off, as this information is quite clearly stated on the website.","9199":"If you only want to see Lions and Pandas (and elephants and giraffes) then it\u2019s not the zoo for you.","9200":"But there is so much more to Edinburgh Zoo than a couple of (albeit important) Pandas.","9201":"We did see the Sun Bears which my son was absolutely thrilled with as they are his favourite bear and he has never seen one before (we usually visit Blackpool Zoo).","9202":"Top tip from my boys for enjoying the zoo: be patient and quiet!","9203":"On lots of occasions we were quietly waiting at an enclosure, other visitors ran up to the enclosure, looked for 30 seconds before declaring the enclosure empty and running off only for a Sun Bear to suddenly appear or the Hippos to emerge from a pool.","9204":"Absolutely fantastic day at Edinburgh Zoo.","9205":"We will definitely return.","9206":"This zoo is a great place for kids to play but for animals you can forget it.","9207":"Half of the animals advertised weren't there and apart from the penguins and rhinos the cages left a lot to be desired.","9208":"Last nail in the coffin was one of the cages with birds inside....","9209":"it looked like a sewer....felt sorry for the poor birds locked up in that mess....","9210":"first and last visit.","9211":"i have been to quiet a few zoo's from plymouth to south lakes and edingburgh zoo is the worse, who puts there top attraction at the very top of a hill so my father who is 84 couldnt get to it, yes you can ride in a bus to get there, thats fine, but you still have a large hill to climb, we took one look and got on the bus.","9212":"so upset.we had dinner in the jungle cafe, never again, i would have got a better meal at mcdonald, the food cost more than the meals we have had on holiday the food was awful, it gave me indegestion and it made me ill, the restaurant looked like it hadnt been clean in weeks, toilets lets just say wasnt nice.couldnt see half the animals  because they were inside.","9213":"Was surprised to read so many 1 star reviews-","9214":"yes some areas need a clean but it has just been summer hols and I expect the priority is animal welfare.","9215":"We saw 3 closed enclosures.","9216":"Yes son #2 was upset that the pandas didn\u2019t show for him but they\u2019ve only been in the new place for a month and are notoriously shy animals.","9217":"Dad returned later and videoed one that appeared thanks to a keeper.","9218":"We were more excited to see animals we had not seen before or even heard of in some cases!The boys loved seeing the sun bear having a wee.","9219":"Koalas, red panda, rhino, tapirs, chimps.","9220":"22+ animals in fact.","9221":"Really disappointed with our visit to Edinburgh Zoo.","9222":"No Lions on show due to breeding, pandas was outdoor viewing only and they never came out.","9223":"Not many other things to see and the viewing windows were dirty.","9224":"Only good thing was the penguins.","9225":"Definitely won\u2019t be visiting again.","9226":"I was surprised to read such bad reviews of this Zoo (which I read after we went)","9227":"We went spontaneously on our trip to Edinburgh.","9228":"We picked up a leaflet in our hotel reception and thought we\u2019d give it a go.","9229":"There was 10% discount with the leaflet too.","9230":"My only criticism was getting there by bus- we arrived at Edinburgh bus station and according to the leaflet you just \u201chop on a bus\u201d But doesn\u2019t suggest where?","9231":"Took us 45 mins to find a bus stop which we found on Princes St. We haven\u2019t been to Edinburgh before.","9232":"The bus was \u00a34.20 for 2 adults and 1 child.","9233":"And the driver told us where to get off (taxi back to Centre was \u00a310 if you are interested)After that we were really happy.","9234":"We only can compare this to Twycross Zoo in the Midlands or the little Zoo at Drayton Manor Park, but we found it lovely.","9235":"The Scottish children are back in school in late August- perfect timing.","9236":"We felt like we had the zoo to ourselves in the morning- it got busier as the day went on but nothing like Tywcross in the holidays.","9237":"We even got to speak to volunteers who told us a lot about the birds and the chimpanzees.","9238":"The lady on Tigers very patiently guided everyone to get the best tiny glimpse of the sleeping tiger.","9239":"The Penguin area was the best part- they seemed so happy with a mist spraying all over them- the looked so chilled out like they were at the Spa.","9240":"And I stood for sometime on the bridge watching them swim while my daughter played in the play area nearby.","9241":"Ok so we didn\u2019t see the Pandas-","9242":"but they are notoriously illusive aren\u2019t they.","9243":"Not what I was expecting tbh.","9244":"I understand nature and that sometimes animals may not be available for example the lions today are breeding however, no sign of the pandas.","9245":"One tiger hiding in an overgrown enclosure.","9246":"No giraffes.","9247":"No elephants.","9248":"In the monkey house was 3 monkeys.","9249":"Lots of penguins and meerkats though.","9250":"Could tell it was a slow day when a crowd gathered with a zoo worker discussing otters...","9251":"Enclosures looked small, dated and sadly lacking animals.","9252":"Won't be going again.","9253":"I have been to the zoo numerous times but not for a number of years.","9254":"It has gone downhill massively and we were left disappointed.","9255":"Partly our fault that we didn\u2019t check what animals they have here but for a start they don\u2019t have elephants, gorillas or giraffes at all, the lions are completely out of viewing at the moment due to the breeding season, there\u2019s one tiger I think or we were lucky to see one after a long wait when it emerged from the trees.","9256":"No other big cats and the pandas can only be viewed from outside at the minute, which they didn\u2019t appear in the time we were there.","9257":"The pandas are also relocated at the top of the steep hill and furthest away for everything so you can\u2019t just keep popping back to see if they have appeared.","9258":"So many of the enclosures were empty and those that weren\u2019t, some bad extremely dirty windows making them hard to see much!","9259":"Also very steep and hard with the pushchair but that can\u2019t be helped.","9260":"So basically all that money and an expensive stay in the hotel next door to see animals we can see just about anywhere with the odd exception eg penguins and chimpanzees!","9261":"For the price of the entry fee, I was expecting a lot and was sorely disappointed.","9262":"The animals we seen the most of were wasps.","9263":"Most of the enclosures appeared empty and were overgrown so it was difficult to see what was inside.","9264":"Saw a pandas back from a distance as the viewing section was closed.","9265":"A big fanfare was made for the penguin parade and hundreds of people lined up to watch two little penguins waddling past.","9266":"Not much of a parade.","9267":"I definitely won\u2019t be back.","9268":"Travel a fair distance to see the pandas and were not dissapointed, the keeper  encouraged him out so one half could.","9269":"The rest of the zoo is very good clean and animals all  appeared happy.","9270":"Staff were knowledgeable and very visable.","9271":"Cost was average for a zoo.","9272":"The only downfall (as with all of these places) is the prices in the shop that you have to walk through to exit.","9273":"The trip today (22\/0819) to Edinburgh Zoo was really disappointing for my family and I.My 2 children were really excited about going to the Zoo but only to be let down massively.","9274":"The Lions were unavailable due to it being the breeding season, by the time we got to the Kuala enclosure it was shut (3.30).The Panda enclosure was shut you could only view from outside.","9275":"The penguin parade consisted of 3 penguins.","9276":"One enclosure had ducks in it and a snowy owl, not really what you expect from a Zoo...","9277":"The only positives were the Rhino and the chimps but it wasnt worth over \u00a360 for that.","9278":"We wont be rushing back anytime soon.","9279":"For the size and amount of walking involved, we didn't feel it worth the high price entry compared to small local animal parks.","9280":"Many enclosures looked empty and over grown, and my 5 year old asked where all the exciting animals were.","9281":"If animals were in the enclosure's they could be made more viewable surely?","9282":"The panda viewing was restricted due to breeding times, and the tigers hidden somewhere in the overgrown enclosure.","9283":"Penguins were the only highlight, as meerkats and lemurs etc can be seen pretty much any animal parks these days, for half the price and a lot less walking!Shame as i used to love it here and got the boys full of excitement before hand telling them it would be great.","9284":"We are members of another zoo in the UK and got free entry to Edinburgh.","9285":"If we\u2019d paid for this visit I\u2019d want a refund.","9286":"The grounds are a disgrace.","9287":"Overgrown with nettles across the paths and weeds everywhere.","9288":"The enclosures are very tired and hardly any animals were visible.","9289":"I don\u2019t expect to see every animal and am all for respecting the animals privacy but these enclosures are dull and the glass is very dirty.","9290":"The design makes for poor viewing.","9291":"Quite a few enclosures are empty too.","9292":"The kolas and penguins are the best thing.","9293":"It seems very clear that the pandas are swallowing vast amounts of money from Edinburgh Zoo and there\u2019s very little funding left to enhance a rather tired zoo.","9294":"It has great potential that is currently not tapped into.","9295":"Excellent zoo, quite hilly but super enclosures.","9296":"You may have a wait to see the panda, afternoon is best to see one, so I\u2019m told.","9297":"Just though I'd write a review to neutralise some of the very negative reviews I've just read on here.","9298":"It's not that bad.","9299":"I probably wouldn't re visit if I'm honest mainly because I didnt realise just how steep it was.","9300":"If you have mobility issues this is not the zoo for you.","9301":"We didn't see the pandas unfortunately but I'd prefer not to than have them paraded just for public amusement.","9302":"The koalas, various monkeys and penguins were particularly popular.","9303":"Lovely place to visit staff are very helpful if you have a disability there is mobility transport to help get some places the animals are well looked after do not forget to go see the pandas","9304":"We booked a trip to Edinburgh as our son wanted to see the pandas so the recent dreadful reviews were quite worrying.","9305":"I was concerned we were travelling a long way for no reason.","9306":"However, we visited today and had a fantastic time (despite the torrential weather).","9307":"We saw ALL the animals (except for the lions who are shut for breeding).","9308":"The panda was the obvious highlight","9309":"but we also enjoyed seeing the penguin parade, the sun bear and the amazing chimpanzees :)","9310":"Yes the zoo is on a hill but so is most of Edinburgh!","9311":"It\u2019s easily manageable with plenty of flat areas and other animals to view on the way up.","9312":"Our son enjoyed the play parks and we all loved the Lego sculptures.","9313":"And there are indeed some wasps about but no more so than at any other zoo or theme park we\u2019ve visited.","9314":"We had a fab day and would recommend a visit.","9315":"The four stars is solely based on the fact that we felt it to be slightly overpriced considering it is not a very large zoo and we were done in just over 3 hours.","9316":"Very disappointed with our family visit to the zoo (2 adults 2 children 6 and 2) paths over grown with nettles - which my littlest got stung, a simple strimmer other the area would have sorted that.","9317":"Enclosures very over grown and glass on some enclosures so dirty you couldn\u2019t see through them, also very dirty and smelly( I\u2019m used to farm life, so smells don\u2019t normally bother me )See very little of the animals, I understand you can\u2019t make animals preform, but reading other reviews this wasn\u2019t a one off , panda and tiger inside enclosures were closed and neither made an out door appearance.","9318":"If it hadn\u2019t been for the bright and colourful Lego creatures around the zoo the whole experience would have been very dull.","9319":"I took a four year old child to Edinburgh Zoo on Thursday 15th August.","9320":"I chose that day because the weather forecast was good.","9321":"That was about the only good thing about the day because the Zoo was an absolute disgrace.","9322":"I don't know why they advertise as a zoo because animals etc are few and far between.","9323":"The only good part was the penguin rock.","9324":"How do you explain to a small child that enclosures are empty when they are looking forward to seeing animals.","9325":"She spent most of the day at the playparks,thank goodness for the good weather,because there was next to nothing to see except penguins,a tired tiger and some meerkats.","9326":"I was absolutely embarrassed listening to a family of tourists who said that they felt like asking for a refund of their admission fee.","9327":"I could not blame them.","9328":"As for the pandas ,I don't believe they exist !!","9329":"Do not waste your money on this so called Zoo,I feel that \u00a326 to see what we saw and spending the day in the playparks was a joke.","9330":"Oh I nearly forgot there was a couple of birds and maybe half a dozen fish.","9331":"Keep your money take your children somewhere else,I had read bad reviews and decided to give it a chance.","9332":"The bad reviews are 100 per cent correct.","9333":"With having 2 young children we have visited lots of different places and go on lots of family days out and this is the first time I have felt the need to write a bad review.","9334":"We visited Edinburgh zoo while staying nearby and left after seeing hardly any animals.","9335":"The lion enclosure was closed and although I understand this is in the best interests of the animals during mating season we were not advised of this when purchasing the ticket, the indoor panda viewing area was also closed.","9336":"Even the animals that were in the outdoor enclosures we struggled to see as everywhere is very overgrown.","9337":"As expected when visiting places like this the food and drinks are very over priced, felt sorry for people who had brought picnics as the place is that over run with wasps they struggled to eat outside.","9338":"Toilets were dirty and although I understand public toilets can become dirty easily they were dirty first thing on the morning which was surprising.","9339":"We left at 2pm after waking round the full zoo twice and seeing hardly any animals a long with a lot of other very disappointed visitors.","9340":"Doncaster zoo and Blackpool zoo are well worth a visit","9341":"but I would definitely not waste your money on Edinburgh zoo.","9342":"Best thing is the Penguins everything else is up a 1:1 hill and the animals wont be on show anyway, the Penguin cafe is staffed by off hand people who\u2019d rather be anywhere else, the food as overpriced as you\u2019d expect and mediocre and I\u2019d wash my hands on the way out because everything is sticky and the floor hasn\u2019t been swept id guess for 48 hours.","9343":"It's the first time I have been to the zoo for a few years and I was amazed how much it had changed it was brilliant before now some how they ve made it better.","9344":"It is value for money the grounds are stunning and clean the staff are friendly and approachable.last but most important the animals stunning well looked after and loved.","9345":"Deffo be back well done keep up the great work","9346":"I had been wanting to visit Edinburgh Zoo since they first got their Giant Pandas.","9347":"So needless to say I was very excited for this trip.","9348":"Thankfully we managed to get 1 day of beautiful weather in a week of rain, so there were actually some animals to visit.","9349":"There is a great variety of animals and they all had very nice, clean enclosures with lots of food out.","9350":"I mainly visited purely to see the pandas, and had to keep coming back to the enclosure in the hope of catching a glimpse, eventually the keeper had to tell everyone to be quiet and encouraged him out with some food (after I has stood in the same spot waiting for 1.5 hours).","9351":"The indoor viewing was closed while they get used to their new enclosure, which is right at the top of a very steep hill.","9352":"I consider myself fairly fit and still found it a trek to get to the top.","9353":"There were a few feedings and talks throughout the day which were interesting, and the restaurant had some really nice pizza.","9354":"The gift shop is also quite affordable, and my basket of panda merchandise wasn't nearly as expensive as I expected.","9355":"Unfortunately the lions weren't visible at all during the day, and most of their viewing areas were closed because of the breeding season, which was a bit of a shame.","9356":"To summarise; great day out, but maybe not so good in the rain as I imagine they all hide inside.","9357":"Very very hilly and steep.","9358":"The staff at this well kept and beautiful zoo are fantastic.","9359":"They went out of their way to ensure my son had a very special visit, the best day ever, in his own words.","9360":"I cannot thank them enough!","9361":"Highly recommend a visit if even to help support the fantastic conservation work they do.","9362":"Thank you Alison for taking time out with my son and to the rest of the staff who organised such a memorable visit.","9363":"Highly recommend a day here, we spent from 11am until zoo closing here, plently to see and do.","9364":"Cant wait to come back to Edinburgh and another visit.","9365":"So we paid nearly \u00a350 for two adults and a child to visit this zoo, it was part of our holiday at seahouses.","9366":"When we got there we also had to pay a further \u00a34 for parking.","9367":"And I can honestly say I won\u2019t be returning in a hurry!","9368":"To start with half of the animals weren't in there pens such as hippos, pandas and monkeys, and that\u2019s to name a few.","9369":"We were so disappointed after travelling 2 hours to get there and my son kept asking were all the animals were.","9370":"The place was swarmed in bees you - we had brought a picnic and couldn\u2019t eat it because no matter were we were in park if we pulled out the food we were swarmed in about 10 of them!","9371":"One of the most disappointing zoos I\u2019ve ever been too!","9372":"Unfortunately we visited today, 15th August.","9373":"Decided to holiday in Edinburgh as then we\u2019d get to see the pandas that live at the zoo.","9374":"And the other animals, because obviously a zoo like Edinburgh zoo would have ALL the animals won\u2019t it?","9375":"Yeah okay.","9376":"Pull the other one, it\u2019s got bells on.","9377":"The whole zoo is next to a holiday inn, the clutch on your car will take a serious battering if there\u2019s more than one car in front of you to get into the car park, the hill the zoo is on is steeper than a steep thing, if you\u2019re any kind of \u201cdifferently abled\u201d this zoo is not the zoo for you, the animals don\u2019t exist, the lions are closed because they\u2019re sensitive at \u201cthat time of the year\u201d and the pandas are in an outside only viewing enclosure and they sleep for 16-20 hours a day.","9378":"Indoors.","9379":"We got the mobility taxi to what we thought would be the top of the hill.","9380":"It wasn\u2019t, the taxi couldn\u2019t go further.","9381":"So we trudged (slowly, with inhalers) up the rest of the hill, and looked for the pandas.","9382":"They\u2019re visible on an iPad that the staff member (the one with the worst job in the world - that of explaining to the visitors to the panda exhibit that you can\u2019t see the actual pandas) showed us for about 20 seconds.","9383":"Pandas over.","9384":"We tried a few more enclosures and lots were shut or had the viewing parts roped off.","9385":"We saw about 6 animals on our visit.","9386":"The koalas were sleeping but visible, the wildcat was also sleeping but visible.","9387":"The red panda (because you can always rely on a red panda to be sleeping!) woke and we got to watch it climb down the tree into its little house.","9388":"We saw some sorry looking flamingos trying to find the way out of their enclosure, some black storks flapping and a gibbon scratching his chin.","9389":"And some tapirs.","9390":"That\u2019s 7 animals.","9391":"Anyway.","9392":"We wouldn\u2019t recommend the zoo.","9393":"We\u2019re not the only ones, lots of other visitors we spoke too had also had a rubbish day out and not seen any animals.","9394":"If only we\u2019d  have checked trip advisor before we went!In the interests of fairness, something good was the Grasslands Restaurant - the food was lush and very reasonable for the price and the service was excellent.","9395":"So to sum up - good food, shame about the zoo.","9396":"Utter waste of time and money.","9397":"During a recent stay in Edinburgh.","9398":"We decided to visit the zoo.","9399":"Sadly not impressed.","9400":"A lot of the animals were nowhere to be seen and the state of one of the eating areas was in a disgusting state.","9401":"This zoo lacks one crucial element - animals!On the day we visited the Lions and Panda\u2019s were locked away.","9402":"Granted this isn\u2019t a performing circus but there was absolutely no mention of this on the website or even on arrival - obviously worried that people simply won\u2019t come if there are no main attractions - errrr yeah!There was one small sign by the Panda enclosure that could be easily missed.","9403":"And still there were loads of people milling around waiting to see the main attraction that the A4 piece of paper crucially pointed out would not be making an appearance - no staff in sight.","9404":"This was a running theme, monkey enclosure empty, rhinos nowhere to be seen etc etc etc.","9405":"In their defence more wombats and penguins than you could shake a stick at, other than that an absolute waste of money.","9406":"Should be prosecuted under the trade description act, it\u2019s not a zoo!","9407":"Maybe rename as what it is - a long boring walk on a hill.","9408":"We, like some people, traveled 100s of miles to visit the only Pandas in the UK - but where were they?As someone else mentioned here, the zoo needs to be honest with people and say that even after a steep climb, you are not guaranteed to see the Pandas.","9409":"At the enclosure, they also make you queue just to look through a window into a small section of the enclosure, but all you see is your reflection and no Panda as he is probably too scared to come out.","9410":"Why allow people to queue when the staff can clearly see he is not there.","9411":"We were then told they let them outside at 2:30.","9412":"The truth is, the door to the outside was open all the time, but by nature, they are timid creatures, so why usher people further up the hill to - yet again - not see the Pandas.!We fully understand the importance of preserving the Panda population, but the zoo needs to be honest prior to taking your money.","9413":"We agree with all other comments here about the lack of other animals in the zoo.","9414":"Lots of Giraffe pictures, then you get up close and read that they are actually \"crowdfunding\" to bring a Giraffe to the zoo.","9415":"Again, very misleading - not amusing.","9416":"For all the effort and cost to build the new Panda enclosure, they have lost a trick!.","9417":"It could have been made with one-way glass and soundproofing so you could see the Pandas, yet they wouldn't be scared by the sound and view of humans.","9418":"This a such a lost opportunity which makes it not fit for purpose.","9419":"Parking was limited, and we had to park on the street.","9420":"BTW....","9421":"beware, the parking wardens patrol at 4pm and slap a ticket on your windscreen.","9422":"A great shame, as we have been to many zoos and to see this was a huge disappointment.","9423":"Such lost opportunities that need to be addressed asap.","9424":"Please put the entry fee into updating enclosures and being honest about the zoos main attraction that people travel for miles to see.!","9425":"Given that all the animals here are invisable, one can only assume this zoo is best seen at night, rumours have spread that phantom animals fill this zoo at night!","9426":"If, like our family, you decide to visit this zoo in the day I HIGHLY SUGGEST YOU spend your money elsewhere, at Edinburgh zoo you eill only witness empty enclosures and feel utter disappointment.","9427":"AVOID.","9428":"I will save repeating what has already been said in so many reviews ...","9429":"I only wish I had read them before the visit.","9430":"In short, not many real animals (lots of Lego models), no pandas (other than on an ipad), enclosures unkept, rats running round in the bird enclosure, lots of signs saying closed for maintenance.","9431":"DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY,","9432":"QUITE SIMPLY THE WORST ZOO (or visitor attraction) I HAVE VISITED IN YEARS.","9433":"We visited the zoo with friends and went especially for the giant panda\u2019s.","9434":"Like Loch Ness there is a rumor that there are animals living there, but you don\u2019t see them.1\/","9435":"the whole zoo is on a steap hill.","9436":"Defenitely not for older people or people who are not fit.","9437":"Just ridiculous.2\/ where are the animals?","9438":"There was a Lego animals exhibition going on.","9439":"We saw more Lego animals then real animals.","9440":"One animal per enclosure and they were not outside.","9441":"Weather was a normal scottisch day.","9442":"I understand that they cannot make the animals come outside but this was like they were on strike.","9443":"We saw only a pig, a deer, 2 rhinos and the penguins3\/ finally: the moment supreme: the giant panda.","9444":"Al these people scrambling up the top of the hill  ,out of breath to see these creatures.","9445":"Parents with their children in trolleys, people in wheelchairs ( bless them going up that hill)Only to arrive and see a note on the enclosures saying they were just rehoused to a new habitat and were still getting used to it and therefore would not come out.","9446":"So al these people going up a hill and waiting for the enclosure hoping for these animals to come out.","9447":"Not happening offcourse ....\u2019","9448":"Maybe they can put a member of staff in a pandasuit and have him running about in the enclosure.","9449":"Atleast then there would be something to see.4 persons: 80 pounds for what .......","9450":"Very disappointed and a waste of money","9451":"there was wasps everywhere.","9452":"Hardly could see many animals due to the miskept enclosures which were overgrown and full of stinging nettles.the only good animals were the penguins as we had a clear view of them except the viewing windows were green and obscured our view of the penguins.","9453":"During the visit we came across many empty enclosures and also piles of rubbish ( old enclosure fences etc)the enclosures were not clean and we also saw many rats inside the bird enclosure.we traveled to see the pandas however they were closed off without any notices either outside the zoo or on the website.towards the end of the day we were going to get ice cream however we were disgusted by the state of the ice cream hut , ice cream was all over the walls along with dirt and bugs .Don\u2019t","9454":"waste your time","9455":"This is a great family day out loads of animals to see.","9456":"You walk high up and see miles from the top could do with shelter for when it rains.","9457":"But great day out and see the penguin parade.","9458":"Visited yesterday, big queues to the car park with cars blocking the lanes on the roads, bit of a nightmare.","9459":"Pay \u00a34 for the car park.","9460":"Big queues to get into the pre booked section","9461":"but we didnt stand for too long.","9462":"You get warned its very hilly so my bet is to head to the top first and then work your way down.","9463":"We couldnt find the best route as there isnt really routes, just  free for all wander around with lack of signage.","9464":"The animals we did see looked well cared for, however, most were hidden and we were looking at grass and trees for a lot of them.","9465":"Wish we were told that the pandas were not for viewing, before we hiked all the way up to them.","9466":"Not a panda to be seen, crowds of people hanging around the enclosure waiting for them had no idea they weren't coming out.....  big queues for toilets a lot of the time too.","9467":"We had to eat inside as too many wasps, very expensive, but was prepared for this.","9468":"Gift shop very pricey too, again, we knew it would be.","9469":"Overall, we were there for 5 hours, didn't see that many animals.","9470":"We had a great family day out together which was lovely but don't go expecting a big zoo because its not.","9471":"We visited Edinburgh zoo yesterday and had an lovely time seeing all the animals, our fave are the chimpanzees, also loved all the amazing Lego sculptures around the whole zoo, was so impressed with them all, and was pleasantly surprised to find out about Lego tent where kids are encouraged to build models, my two girls spent ages building all different things, special mention to the staff in there who were fantastic with mine and all the other kids, I think he is called Frank, he made everyone feel so welcome and was saying lots of lovely comments when the kids ran up to him to show him what they had made, my youngest is only 3 and was struggling a little to build something so he made her a turtle which she loved, was really lovely of him, really can't wait to come back for a visit before the Lego exhibition finishes","9472":"Arrived just before 10am.","9473":"Queue for pre booked tickets was much longer than purchase on the day.","9474":"Was served by Peter who was in a nutshell awesome.","9475":"Charged us the correct rates 1 student, 1 child and 1 carer.","9476":"Total cost \u00a330.Peter explained all about the Lego sculptures currently on displayPeter told us about the mobility service the zoo offers and arranged for the mobility car to take us straight up to the lions.","9477":"Charlie driving the car was awesome as well.","9478":"The zoo is very hilly if you have mobility issues the mobility car can pick you off and drop you off at certain points.","9479":"We only used it to take us to the lions.","9480":"To be honest pushing a wheelchair or a buggy is a nightmare.","9481":"Too many uneven surfaces that caused the wheels to get stuck and potential tip overs.","9482":"Our day was pretty averageLions we did see despite the enclosure being limited due to breeding season.","9483":"Pandas haha only saw the ones in the gift shop.","9484":"Tigers again plenty in the gift shop.","9485":"We saw the wildcat feeding and talk which was really interesting.","9486":"The same guy took the penguin parade and he was very knowledgeableLunch","9487":"we went to the jungle cafe.2 cheeseburgers with chips and 2 diet cokes.","9488":"\u00a325!!!!!!!!!!!!!There are as others have mentioned lots of wasps but not the zoos faultWe spent a good  4 and a half hours so did get out monies worth.","9489":"If we had paid full price I wouldn\u2019t have been impressed.","9490":"Sadly I think the zoo has had its day.","9491":"I know they are doing fantastic conservation work which is very interesting","9492":"Having booked tickets online for the next day we arrived to be told that the lion and panda indoor viewing areas were closed.","9493":"We would not have booked and traveled if the website had made this clear but it hadn\u2019t mentioned anything, selling tickets for set days surely brings the responsibility of letting guests know any disruption scheduled on those days?","9494":"These closures were known and for weeks not days incidentally.","9495":"In the end we saw many empty enclosures, heard a lion growl and our 6 year old asked to leave after half an hour and I couldn\u2019t really argue with him.","9496":"It\u2019s a hobby zoo In Badly laid out surroundings with very poor viewingMy advice go to the highland wildlife park owned by the same people, it\u2019s brilliant as is blairdrummond safari","9497":"parkThis was a monumental waste of money","9498":"and I don\u2019t often complain but when I wrote an email I got a-really bland and unhelpful reply with no answers to the points I had raisedMany other disappointed  family\u2019s on the day alsoAvoid this if you want a family day out- go to a park or watch lion king on the TV","9499":"I visited today with my husband and two children (12 and 8) I got my tickets from the kids pass app which made it considerably cheaper (there is a fee for this app but worth getting) lWe had to queue to get into the car park and payed \u00a34 to pack for the day (cash only)Very helpful and kind staff explained the zoo map and the different shows\/talks that were on today.","9500":"The weather was lovely and sunny but caused lots of wasps (obviously not the zoos fault and they did have signs displayed explaining they were doing all they could about the wasps)The enclosures are nice and big for the animals and we got to see the amazing pandas outside.","9501":"We did have to queue to see the indoor enclosure only for them to be let out into the outdoor.","9502":"Typical, but glad we got to see them.","9503":"The whole zoo is on a hill so be mindful of this when you visit.","9504":"Food, drink and ice cream very very expensive!!!","9505":"Bring your own!The penguin enclosure is huge and amazing.","9506":"I love the penguins.","9507":"Unfortunately we couldn\u2019t see the lions and the high viewing was closed which was a shame.","9508":"Overall great day and would return in the future.","9509":"Rigby family from Preston, Lancashire :)","9510":"Just had a great day at Edinburgh zoo where I realised my lifelong dream of seeing a panda for real \u2764\ufe0fEven though it\u2019s extremely hilly and my friend had mobility problems we had no worries.","9511":"We simply called the zoo mobility car and Charlie ( who was such a kind and knowledgeable man) drove my friend and I to the top of the zoo where we could then amble down hill and see the animals.","9512":"If we needed to call again for more help we could at any point.","9513":"Great zoo, great idea and  great to meet such a gentleman as Charlie xx","9514":"Thia zoo is a disgrace!","9515":"Firstly, taking money on a hill for the car park causing massive exhaust fumes and smoldering clutches , the entrance stinks from fumes.","9516":"There are no animals to be seen as most of the enclosures are empty.","9517":"Further no giraffes, elephants, seals","9518":"No aquarium","9519":"no a reptile house of note.","9520":"The fictitious lion closure was closed alleged breeding activity!!.","9521":"The only animals you will see lego animals stuck all over the place.","9522":"The alleged pandas never made any appearance.","9523":"In my opinion it should be served with a foreclosure notice.","9524":"The gift shop is another joke, trying to sell plastic elephants for \u00a328.","9525":"Who ever runs the Zoo needs a brain transplant!","9526":"There is a plague of wasps.","9527":"These people in charge might think Ooops wasps everywhere let's get rid of them using wasps spray.","9528":"Avoid at all costs and spend your money elsewhere.","9529":"Even the butterfly enclosure at Dobbies is a far better visit than this joke of a Zoo.","9530":"Further what animals was seen a chimp even he looked unhappy.","9531":"Any what num nut decided to put a Zoo on a hill anyway!!!","9532":"It's not the best zoo I've visited but its also not the worst.","9533":"The penguins and the tigers are probably the highlight for me since you can actually see them compared to a lot of the other enclosures.","9534":"I've been to Edinburgh zoo 3 times and I've only seen the pandas once as their indoor viewing area always seems to be closed - a but weird for their star attraction.","9535":"Definitely not what it used to be.","9536":"Enjoyed a family day out but glad I had corporate tickets as not sure I would have paid the full price.","9537":"The zoo itself was enjoyable, lots for kids to see however had lunch at the jungle cafe, massively overpriced and the food was dreadful, would go as far as to say disgusting, would recommend bringing a picnic and sitting at one of the many tables and neches doted around the zoo","9538":"I was visiting Edinburgh for two shows at the Fringe in the afternoon so took advantage to visit the zoo in the morning.","9539":"At \u00a321 it's pricier than recent zoos I've visited in Berlin, Rome and Barcelona.","9540":"There are some pretty steep hills to climb to get to the top but a bus service is offered.","9541":"No access to the giant pandas was disappointing, but saw the rest of the animals.","9542":"An average experience.","9543":"Me and my partner came the whole way from Belfast to go to Edinburgh zoo and at least half of the zoo was closed, this was not made clear before we paid to get in.","9544":"Restaurant and cafe prices are through the roof and personally would not advise this at all!!","9545":"We arrived at the zoo to be told the car park was full.","9546":"We were late arriving it took us 3 hours to get there due to traffic and roadworks (not the zoos fault).","9547":"We were told to park in the bus lane,  which was also full for around a mile.","9548":"We would have to be out the bus lane for 4pm or get a ticket.","9549":"We then had to queue for 20 minutes to get in, another 20 mins for the toilet.","9550":"We had no time to queue again for drinks.","9551":"The pandas had moved enclosure,  we walked to the top if the hill on a few occasions, not easy pushing a pram but they didn't come out.","9552":"In fact most animals didn't come out so we didn't see much.","9553":"The penguins also didn't come out for the parade and due to it being so busy we were stuck there for a while as couldn't move the pram through crowds.","9554":"Then that was our day over as we had to get back to the car.","9555":"Far too busy,  too expensive for the time there,  seen hippos and flamingos and that was about it.","9556":"I will go again in October as my daughter is desperate to see the pandas,  I have been many times before but it's just far too busy now and parking and staff dont cover it.","9557":"Spent the day at Edinburgh Zoo with my two Grandaughters.","9558":"My youngest is obsessed with Cassowary's we were delighted to finally get a glimpse of the Male the female was sitting on eggs.","9559":"I have been to the Zoo on a few occasions over the years.","9560":"All though we had a good day.","9561":"I was disappointed with the state of the surroundings alot of overgrown plants brambles and nettles preventing small children getting a closer look.","9562":"One of my grandchildren got stung by a nettle.","9563":"All though the day we went the Pandas were allowed outside.","9564":"We didn't get to see them which was  disappointing we understand they are shy animals.","9565":"There were TV screens set up but none of these worked.","9566":"Again lack of attention to detail.","9567":"There was a lot of areas closed off due to developments in progress.","9568":"We travelled along way to come and see the animals.","9569":"We did see some lovely animals and a lot of spectacular Lego animals.","9570":"The Koalas were amazing.","9571":"Dont think I will be rushing back.","9572":"Decided to make the most of the Scottish summer and headed to Edinburgh Zoo especially as my son loves pandas.","9573":"Unfortunately the pandas weren\u2019t out and the penguin parade was non existent as only 1 penguin wanted a walk.","9574":"Apart from that it was fab seeing all the animals and the views at the top of the hill are breathtaking.","9575":"We took our lunch with us but did stop for 3 ice creams & 3 bottles of water - \u00a313 ish - think hubby is still recovering.","9576":"Entry was \u00a355 for 2 adults & 1child which included a donation.","9577":"The zoo currently have brick live on until September where there are animals and aquatics constructed in lego.","9578":"It tells you how many people, how long it took and how many bricks and is impressive.","9579":"See if you can spot them all.","9580":"Be prepared to walk a lot and uphill too!","9581":"If i could give this 0 stars i would!!Absolute rip off!","9582":"Main animals people come to visit such as pandas and lions wernt anywhere to be seen after walking up constant hills staff knew the pandas wont be out as its a new enclosure but no letting people know that before paying!!!We brought our kids especially to see the pandas on a 7 hour round trip i  total to be left dissapointed!","9583":"The only pandas you will see will be toy pandas in the gift shop!The zoo is worst by far ive been to,  Loads of empty enclosures,  we walked up to see thr lions tigers etc but all we seen up that end was what looked like some sort of house cat !","9584":"food and drink prices are shocking!","9585":"Also had to wait over am hour to be served an ice cream as staff so slow!you see more animals made out of lego than actual real life animals throuhout the park!The place is also infested with wasps throughout the park!Driving up into the car park nearly burnt out my clutch as the person takin car park fees was so slow.","9586":"my car actually started smoking up and wasnt the only car who's clutch was seemingly burning outi havnt got 1 good thing to say about this zoo at all,","9587":"The zoo is beautiful.","9588":"W mainly came for the great pandas and the koalas as we do not have these at our zoo.","9589":"The animals all have modern, large compounds which is very nice for the animals.","9590":"The disadvantage is clear: the visitors often do not see them  because they hide.","9591":"The entry tickets are actually quite expensive.","9592":"Therefore it would really be nice to see more.","9593":"Maybe you should consider the installation of cameras so that visitors could at least watch the animals on a screen and be less disappointed.","9594":"It saddens me to write reviews like this.","9595":"We have been spoilt with having Colchester Zoo right on our doorstep but we didn\u2019t know how spoilt until now.","9596":"The entrance to the zoo nearly wiped out our clutch like many others climbing the steep hill in the entrance.","9597":"Half the enclosures were empty or seemed to be at least.","9598":"Speaking to locals and no one have seen the pandas lol.","9599":"Not disabled friendly at all with steep hills.","9600":"What comes to mind is that there are miles and miles of open fields as you head into Edinburgh","9601":"so why place a zoo on a hillside.","9602":"Sorry not for us.","9603":"We went yesterday.","9604":"We left very disapointed.","9605":"Walked up a long steep hill to see the pandas, tigers and lions but we saw 0 of them.","9606":"No pandas, tigers or lions.","9607":"Went in the rhino house","9608":"but they were also not there.","9609":"It was a 6 hour round trip for us which was a complete waste of time.","9610":"The only reason we went was to see the pandas.","9611":"Bus to the zoo, lots of people waiting to enter zoo but didn't have to wait long before being served.","9612":"All staff very friendly and helpful.","9613":"Zoo was very clean and no rubbish about for amount of people around.","9614":"Plenty of room and altogether a lovely day.","9615":"Enjoyed the food especially the leek and chicken pie which was in the grasslands restaurant.","9616":"Just back from Zoo.","9617":"Quite disappointing.","9618":"Lions locked out of site.","9619":"Giant Pandas locked out of site.","9620":"Monkey house pretty emptyBest to appreciate animals on tv","9621":"No pandas no lions tigers no penguin walk, loads of areas fenced off, dirty, in need of re decorating.","9622":"Food bad and ridiculously expensive for sub standard product.","9623":"Offered customer feedback and was told we hear this all the time \ud83d\ude2e Been to many zoos throughout the country this is by far the worst.","9624":"Staff are so kind the monkeys entertain you buy playing and copying you pandas","9625":"do there own thing and are so CUTE I would definitely recommend going here","9626":"Good day out..ticket reasonable price..though some exhibits not available like the Panda's.Signs difficult to follow.couldn't find some animals like the reptiles and insects.","9627":"The penguin parade didn't happen either.","9628":"Well I decided to treat my son and his partner and 3 kids and myself and partner to the zoo we travelled from Carlisle so when we arrived We where looking  forward to it cost \u00a3110 just to enter the zoo","9629":"but we thought it would be worth it little did we no that we didn\u2019t get to see the pandas which up set the girls","9630":"so we went to see the penguins parade but due that the penguin didn\u2019t fancy doing it that was cancelled once again upset kids","9631":"so I got them a ice cream \u00a32.40 for a cone with one scoop of ice cream a extra 50p for a flake a extra 50p for topping and also the cafe was expensive but the bitter pill was lots of empty enclosures the place was dirty and ran down could do with a good clean as the zoo is lacking animals how they can charge full rate is terrible","9632":"so we will not be going back we even checked there web page they do not mention about animal getting rehoused we feel shorted changed","9633":"Travelled from Oxford to see the Pandas which are my daughter\u2019s favourite animal.","9634":"She had visited previously but didnt get to see them cos the female was pregnant.","9635":"This time we didnt get to see them either because they had a new outdoor area which the keepers wanted to get them used to gradually but then had closed the indoor viewing area.","9636":"Needless to say they didnt come outside.","9637":"It would have been good to at least have a webcam of the indoor area so that we could at least see them in some way.","9638":"As the pandas are the \u2018poster\u2019 animals of the zoo it would have been good to have seen them for even a little while.","9639":"We did wait for over 4 hours but no sign.","9640":"I know they are not \u2018performing seals\u2019 as such but maybe there could be a set time when they would be allowed to be visible to the public.","9641":"Other than that we were disappointed with the overall upkeep of the zoo and all the staff seemed a bit fed up and miserable.","9642":"It is a very hilly zoo with uneven surfaces and so not ideal for those with mobility difficulties although they do offer a van for a lift to the top.","9643":"Had a great time with the family and thought the price to enter was reasonable compared to others zoo I.e Chester zoo.","9644":"As others mentioned it is very hilly so you also get a good work out as well as a good day out.","9645":"2 reasons why I won't give 5 stars1.","9646":"Just be honest on entry about the current situation with the pandas, people would appreciate it prior to walking 1 mile up the hill to find out you proberly won't see them.","9647":"Everyone knows the mains reason for vistingbthis zoo is the pandas.2  Waited 20 min for the penguin parade that never happened.","9648":"That is alot of people's time wasted.","9649":"Just stop the parade full stop stuff like this belongs in the circus not a zoo.","9650":"We travelled 200 miles to Come to the zoo.","9651":"Something we have been wanting to do for years.","9652":"Sadly we were all So very disappointed.","9653":"Obviously we came to see the main attraction the pandas but they were in their new homes and never caught even a tiny glimpse of them as it was  outside viewing only .. Gutted!!","9654":"My mum said maybe the rest of the park should hay a tannoy letting people know they are out??","9655":"I also think if we'd have realised the whole zoo was on a steep hill I don't think we would have paid the \u00a350+ for the tickets.","9656":"Not just the disappointment of the pandas but the whole zoo seemed empty and unkept.","9657":"We Couldn't see the lions, the rhino's, saw 1 tiger that was sleeping and the koala were the highlight.","9658":"The penguins pool looked so old and full of grime.","9659":"We didn't stay long as my mum struggled with the hill and we couldn't keep going back up and down.","9660":"Sadly we won't be returning when we have Blackpool zoo on our doorstep .","9661":"The koalas were super cute though and they get my 2 starts","9662":"We booked a trip on the LNER express which was a treat.","9663":"Then taxi from the station to the zoo.","9664":"However the festival had started as well as the military tatoo, so there were lots of people and huge amount of traffic.","9665":"So \u00a313.60 later in a taxi we covered the three miles to the zoo driven by a very friendly lady taxi driver.","9666":"We had looked on trip adviser and we discovered after booking it was on a hill.","9667":"So we waited of the transport but due to construction could not go to the top.","9668":"A warning is there are no toilets at the top so take the chance to use them half way up the hill!","9669":"So it was demanding time for Gran who only just made it to the top of the hill.","9670":"Kids loved the lions and the monkeys, zebras and my seven year old granddaughter could not stop taking photos.","9671":"However no sign of the pandas and had to watch a TV movie.","9672":"Lovely picnic areas to eat our packed lunch.","9673":"Then we made our way downhill (thankfully) towards the penguins for the walk at 1415.","9674":"Lots of empty cages on the way down.","9675":"Then masses of people surrounded the green for the penguin walk and that was cancelled.","9676":"As it was very warm we bought some ice cream magnum  lolly and could not believe they charged \u00a32.50 each, probably a record price!","9677":"Anyhow lots in the penguin park.","9678":"Then due to traffic we had to leave with plenty of time to spare so we did not miss the intercity.","9679":"So an enjoyable day for the kids and a very tiring day for the oldies, so we will not return and pick a zoo built on flat land.","9680":"Arrived on site.","9681":"Cashier initially charged us \u00a343 to enter.","9682":"Then advised as i was about to pay that 10% of this was a donation.","9683":"I refused and it brought it down to \u00a339ish.","9684":"Still a high cost","9685":"but we wanted to see the main attraction.","9686":"Once we had paid we were then advised the the main attraction wouldnt be playing as they hsd been recently been moved to a new enclosure.","9687":"But they still had charged a high entry fee.","9688":"When questioned the advised they dont give out refunds.","9689":"I demanded to see management and the manager advised all refund requests were to be submitted in writing.","9690":"This is a zoo, not the best zoo.","9691":"One of the worst i have visited.","9692":"Not worth the entry fee by any means.","9693":"They did offer free entry for my next visit, but to travel from south wales would not be feasable","9694":"Thoroughly enjoyed our trip, haven\u2019t been to the zoo in about 20years .","9695":"It was extremely well maintained and kept clean despite the number of visitors.","9696":"We unfortunately didn\u2019t see the pandas but have been watching them on panda cam .","9697":"The Lego animals were amazing","9698":"Came here for an exhibition, Chinese lanterns, was excellent!","9699":"Previous visit was good too.. not fit for poor mobility!","9700":"They do offer a \"lift\" service for those who cant quite make it to the top.. very steep hill, best to start at the top and work your way down.","9701":"Best time for Adults (without kids) to enjoy it during the day.. when they are at school..","9702":"We visited on the hottest day of the year!","9703":"This Summer there is a visiting Lego exhibition based at the zoo.","9704":"There are numerous amazing models of marine animals all over the zoo to see over the holidays.","9705":"My children loved those and were excited to see what they could find next.","9706":"Enjoyed seeing all the animals as usual and had a lovely picnic in the sun on the lawn.","9707":"Edinburgh Zoo has new children\u2019s playground\u2019s which offer something for all ages and abilities.","9708":"I have been to the zoo on a number of occasions but not for a few years.","9709":"It is looking decidedly shabby.","9710":"The enclosures were overgrown and you couldn\u2019t see most of the animals, if they were actually there.","9711":"The animals we did manage to find were lovely to see.","9712":"Managed to see a panda just before it decided to go back inside.","9713":"The panda cam was turned off and the inside viewing area isn\u2019t open to the public yet.","9714":"We went to theJungle cafe for lunch, big mistake.","9715":"Staff not interested standing around not serving, food over cooked, cold and expensive.","9716":"One good point was the large Lego animal models dotted around the park.","9717":"We will not be returning!","9718":"We traveled 700 miles and were very disappointed.","9719":"A lot of empty enclosures.","9720":"Some areas run down and old especially the penguins there water was dirty and green with algae.","9721":"Very steep walking.","9722":"We had to wait along time to see the pandas as the indoor viewing was still closed.","9723":"The only good thing was the koala bears.","9724":"Would not recommend","9725":"This zoo is a national disgrace.","9726":"Everywhere was dirty, the enclosures that did have animals in were really untidy and not looked after which meant you couldn\u2019t see the animals.","9727":"The only reason we went was to see the Pandas but of course the indoor viewing was closed.","9728":"I have seen them in China and they don\u2019t manage the Pandas as badly as this place.","9729":"The penguin underwater viewing was only just visible because of the built up of green algae on the windows.","9730":"The map we were given on entry didn\u2019t have half the things on.","9731":"My children were almost run over by a staff member driving a vehicle that they were unable to control and other staff members were rude and unhelpful.","9732":"The entry fee was extortionate too - we will certainly never visit again.","9733":"Should have taken more notice of the comments and saved a bundle of cash, over \u00a370.00 for 2 adults and 3 kids plus \u00a34.00 to park.","9734":"\u00a32.00 a bottle of water.to see more Lego than animals granted they were good models but a distraction from the total lack of animals and cleaning and upkeep.","9735":"On the plus side we got our steps in burnt calories walking up the stereo hill.","9736":"Not for wheelchairs users or pushchairs.","9737":"The penguins are a must see and the main or perhaps the only attraction.","9738":"Toilets were dirty and in need of modernisation and a lack of them in areas.","9739":"Over all a great disappointment and well worth a miss","9740":"Total joke of a zoo ,same crap when I went on a school trip 40 years ago ,said to my wife and kids that we wouldn't see the pandas...surprise surprise not available to view indoors....","9741":"Numerous enclosures with nothing in them and run down ,\u00a32.50 a guy in front of me paid for a small bottle of water ,embarrassment to all the tourists that come to my country.","9742":"Abu Dhabi zoo is the way to do this where you get up close to the animals ,feed the elephants and giraffes by hand for free .Chimpanzee enclosure looks amazing with an outside viewing balcony......that is not available to the public....stop it you couldn't make this nonsense up...\u00a360 entry and an additional \u00a34 for the car park just shut the doors and be done with it...","9743":"Great experience great value & I got to see the only Pandas in the uk ... altogether a pleasant experience and a really good assortment of animals","9744":"Very disappointed today at the zoo a lot of the walk through inclosures where closed so we could not see any of the animals from the outside ie the tiger the pandas some of the enclosures where empty  the food place we went to said it was closed it was only 3 o'clock do they have any baby changing facilities couldn't find any","9745":"I know it's a zoo","9746":"but it was very dirty and smelly I certainly won't be going back for the price it was abismal would not recommend.","9747":"We went to see the Pandas, but ended up finding so much more.","9748":"We loved the Penguins - up close and personal with them, and we could have spend hours watching them.","9749":"Several of the enclosures allowed \"walk thru\" so you were in the enclosure with the animals - wallabys, Lemurs, and some others.","9750":"Beautiful Tiger and the staff talks were informative and entertaining.","9751":"All of the staff were eager to tell about their animals.","9752":"The facilities were clean and well-kept.","9753":"It is built on a hill, so be prepared for a lot of walking on hilly terrain (They do warn you of that as you enter, and offer assistance).","9754":"We stayed at the Holiday Inn which is right next door, which was convenient to just walk across the parking lot to enter.","9755":"Expensive admission and the zoo takes a donation fee off you without permission....","9756":"you have to ask for them to remove it from your overall bill.","9757":"Don't have a problem in donating but it should be done in a different way.","9758":"Didn't see any of the larger animals and the steep climb up to the top is disappointing.","9759":"Caf\u00e9 ok but staff are not friendly and helpful.","9760":"Gift shop great and meerkats at the start are a nice attraction.","9761":"For a start \u00a340 to get in plus \u00a34 parking the canteen was shocking inedible microwaved burgers n baps and chips \u00a316.50, I know the animals do what they want and are not visible but the hill is quite steep very unsatisfactory, winter ever be back","9762":"Fantastic zoo.","9763":"Great selection of animals.","9764":"Lovely, well maintained  grounds.","9765":"(Bring your own sandwiches.)","9766":"We really enjoyed the Zoo, staff were friendly and zoo has some amazing animals.","9767":"They have pandas but we didn\u2019t manage to see them as they didn\u2019t come out!","9768":"We saw tigers - hippos - lions - monkeys and more.","9769":"I will recommend it if you have spare time in Edinburgh","9770":"The zoo was open late for the Lego brick building event.","9771":"It was a great change to the daily routine of the zoo.","9772":"It was also an excellent idea for it to be kid free as usually the zoo is centred around the children!","9773":"There was Lego sculptures of loads of animals and live performances including a magician!There was beer and cider with bbq food and a good court, so something to please everyone!","9774":"You could also go around the zoo to see the animals!","9775":"The rhinos were particularly amazing!","9776":"The penguins were also amazing and some of the animals you could watch for hours!","9777":"Unfortunately due to it being night time we did not get to see a lot of the animals like the pandas, lions and koalas which were some of our favourites :( other than that it was a good night!","9778":"Fab visit with our 6 yearold grandson yesterday.","9779":"Recommend pre booking tickets to save qs nd good saving on entry prices.","9780":"We got mini bus free to top nd worked our way down, quite a steep cl8mb otherwise.","9781":"Plenty of eateries though we took snacks\/ drinks with us.","9782":"Lovely play areas.","9783":"Very clean, tidy zoo nd plenty of rubbish bins.","9784":"Animals great just a shame the penguins didn't fancy walkabout - too hot nd stayed in pool areas.","9785":"Very informative, friendly staff.","9786":"Loved big cats nd monkeys.","9787":"Gift shop good value prices for all.","9788":"The Lego exhibits were amazing.","9789":"The only thing guaranteed here is that the cash registers work.","9790":"I've been to may zoos and I know you don't always see all of the animals, but there are too many empty cages here.","9791":"the place is also generally run down, but still charges an above premium price","9792":"The hill on the way up to the zoo was very steep, and you could smell the cars struggling as the stopped every few seconds to get to the top.","9793":"I would recommend waiting for the minibus to get you to the top,it's free and can take 20 people.","9794":"Pandas were inside so didn't see them but there were lots of animals to see.","9795":"Monkeys,big cats, penguins.","9796":"They were all great to see.","9797":"Took us about 3-4hours in total.","9798":"Being at university in Lancaster my boyfriend","9799":"and I decided to take the train up to the zoo, a better warning could be made of the hill the zoo is set on but there were so many positives, the refillable drinks, the non extortionate snacks and some animals I have never before seen and such a privililedge to see the pandas and other animals and all animals seemed content in their habitats.","9800":"Great day out at the zoo, got in pretty quickly and staff where great, brilliant, although there are steep hills they do make you aware of this and let you know you can be driven to the other side of the zoo.","9801":"Would definitely go again(already been twice)","9802":"We hadn't picked the best day weather wise for our visit.","9803":"It rained aloot of the morning but did brighten up eventually.","9804":"However the zoo was still quite busy.","9805":"It is a lovely spacious zoo, the hills didn't bother us as you expect it being in Edinburgh.","9806":"The enclosures are very spacious and absolutely made with the animals in mind which I guess is the main thing.","9807":"However we found that due to the size of the enclosures and the way the pathways are laid out around them it wasn't always possible to see the animals.","9808":"There were a few pathways closed, some animals were in the process of being moved and some enclosures being updated so it seemed as though there were lots of empty or non accessible areas.","9809":"We did see one of the pandas,.we understand they have recently been moved and still settling in and so felt quite lucky to get a glimpse.","9810":"I appreciate what the zoo are trying to do by providing these vast spaces for the animals but I'm not sure it works as a zoo when paying customers cant then see the animals.","9811":"I admit though the weather played a part.","9812":"The food in the grassland restaurant was lovely and the staff were quite friendly.","9813":"Nice big gift shop at the end.","9814":"The penguins didn't fancy the parade","9815":"but I can't say I blamed them with the weather being as it was.","9816":"We probably wouldn't return to this zoo in all honesty.","9817":"Visited at the end of July with my fianc\u00e9e.","9818":"It was a cloudy and at times rainy day but we really enjoyed ourselves.","9819":"We were staying somewhere 2 hours away so when we arrived the car park was full but the attendant told us we could park on the main road for free until 4pm.","9820":"I popped out and moved my car to the car park just before 4.We headed straight for the Panda enclosure but","9821":"the lazy so and so was sleeping.","9822":"So we kept an eye on the zoo's website and their camera or the panda all day.","9823":"The zoo is a bit hilly but we knew that in advance and wore comfortable shoes, I'd advise you do the same and take care if it rains and the paths can get slippy.","9824":"The map the staff at the front desk give us is a god send.","9825":"It's clear and helped us no end.","9826":"Every day at 2:15 in the 'penguin rocks' area, the keepers invite you to stand around the grassed area and watch as the penguins do a parade around you (this depends on how the penguins feel, they didn't do it for us unfortunately), this would be great for the little ones to see.","9827":"We kept checking the panda cam and saw that Tian Tian had come out if their enclosure so headed there, but by the time we had reached it, they had decided to go back inside (bad luck again in our part) but nether-the-less, you can see what an amazing space the giant panda has and I'm sure when they come out, it's great to see.","9828":"We only had an ice cream when we were there so can't comment on the food.","9829":"Overall we really enjoyed ourselves and would like to come again some time, hopefully getting to see the Giant Panda \ud83d\ude42","9830":"My boyfriend & I went for our anniversary and we both absolutely loved it - there wasn\u2019t much we needed help with but the experiences we did have with staff were great.","9831":"We went to see the otters being fed (we arrived a little late so didn\u2019t get a fab view, hence there being no pics however the man explaining everything went into great detail and I actually enjoyed listening to what he was saying) and we made our way around the entire zoo - sadly we couldn\u2019t see all animals but it was an overall amazing experience for the two of us!","9832":"We\u2019re already planning to go back next time we are in edinburgh","9833":"My husband and I visited the zoo earlier today.","9834":"I would highly recommend arriving early - we arrived 15 mins before it opened and there were already queues forming.","9835":"There were also queues forming to get in as we were leaving.","9836":"The zoo is lovely - the enclosures are lovely and seem adequate for the animals.","9837":"There are a good range of animals.","9838":"The on-site shops\/restaurants are, as expected, quite expensive.","9839":"Highly recommend.","9840":"COMPLETE RIP OFF make sure you take your own food \u00a316 for two sandwiches two bottles of water and two packets of crisps RIP-OFF \ud83d\ude21\ud83d\ude21","9841":"We visited on probably the hottest day of the year, and so the animals were probably inside cooling down, as we saw very little of them.","9842":"No tigers, lions or pandas (which my daughter was super excited to see).The cafe and the gift shop were quite expensive too.","9843":"One small plastic bag of Lego pieces to build a small tiger was \u00a315.Unsure if we would return, however the staff were very friendly.","9844":"'After Hours : Bricks & BBQ' - This review is of an evening event and not general day admission.","9845":"This promised to be an evening to 'take a wander through the Zoo after hours, enjoy a brew and grab a bite from the BBQ on the lawn...our wonderful Zoo team & guests will be delivering a variety of entertainment and animal encounters'.","9846":"After a queue to park, and even longer queue to enter (with a pre-paid ticket), it quickly became apparent there would be no animal encounters as they were either all asleep or the exhibits were closed.","9847":"We did see the rhinos and the bored penguins had nowhere to hide but otherwise it was a walk round a park.","9848":"The queue for the only BBQ tent was so long that we opted for the zoo's own catering and got a second rate burger and chips (after also queuing) and couldn't face waiting for a drink.","9849":"They needed more vendors, better organisation and making sure a selection of exhibits were open and viewable.","9850":"We were looking forward to this but wished we hadn't bothered.","9851":"\u00a350 for a walk round a park and a chewy burger - absolute rip off.","9852":"We managed to get corporate discount on tickets for 2 adults and 2 children and even with the 55% saving I'm still disgusted.","9853":"This zoo is diabolical!!","9854":"Firstly, it's all up a steep hill, so if you're pushing a buggy or in a wheelchair, I'd say just forget it.","9855":"We seen more squirrels and rabbits than any other animal.","9856":"The enclosures are mostly empty, filthy, overgrown, dirty windows etc.","9857":"The animals that we did see did not look happy at all.","9858":"The food is grossly overpriced and bland.","9859":"Complete waste of time and money.","9860":"Go elsewhere.","9861":"I absolutely loved my trip to the zoo.","9862":"I went mainly just wanting to see the giant pandas but ended up falling in love with all the animals.","9863":"There is so much to see and various zones \/ areas so you could easily spend 4 - 5 hours wandering around.","9864":"There are a couple of places to get food on site although they closed before we got chance to get anything so can't comment on the quality.","9865":"As you'd expect the gift shop is full of cute animal themed gifts and they have something to fit every budget so you don't have to spend a fortune to get a memento.","9866":"I went here for a solo trip out.","9867":"The staff were friendly, the zoo was well laid out and the animals were in good enclosures too.","9868":"Although my first visit, in 2016, was a bit more enjoyable, I don't think the lack of animals made a difference as I still enjoyed my day out.","9869":"There were loads of places to eat too.","9870":"The penguin parade was good to see again.","9871":"My memories of Edinburgh zoo, was tiny enclosures, and glass areas where children would squash up against to view the animals.","9872":"It\u2019s is clear that the zoo, is trying to modernise.","9873":"The enclosures are massive, so the animals don\u2019t have to put up with gawking people.","9874":"Every enclosure has places of privacy for the animals, which I think shows respect to the animals.","9875":"We went during the adults only late-night event, and we were warned on entry, that a lot of the animals have been fed, and may be in hiding.","9876":"Till September there are Lego animals all over the Zoo, and they are sea themed.","9877":"Killer whales, manatees, eels... there are a lot to see.","9878":"A lot of people are disappointed with the lack of animals, but I felt it was better.","9879":"It is obvious the zoo are pushing forward with changes, and I will gladly visit again to see what happens.","9880":"We were a bit daunted by the hillside positioning of the zoo, but fortunately there were  plenty of resting places.","9881":"If you have small children, think about a stroller or wagon as the hill can be quite fatiguing.","9882":"The exhibits are quite lovely and the animals appeared very comfortable in their habitat ~ many of which were well forested and had plenty of hiding spaces, ledges, tree top roosts and rope swings.","9883":"Most exhibits allowed for close ups, although many of the animals were not visible.","9884":"But the zoo's very clean, has lots of services (food, restrooms, gift shop, etc.)","9885":"and well worth seeing.","9886":"We had lunch at the restaurant and found the food to be quite good and reasonably priced.","9887":"Not impressed to be honest.","9888":"We did see the pandas but the new viewing platforms have tall bushes in front of them and they were in the distance, though the new indoor viewing isnt finished yet.","9889":"Only one tiger, which we didnt see.","9890":"there are 2 lions and we did see one from a distance.","9891":"Penguins were good.","9892":"Managed to see koalas.","9893":"chimps,gibbons...however a lot if enclosures were empty.","9894":"Must be a sign of age...as the hill to the top where the pandas are is very steep.","9895":"Definitely dont think we will return.","9896":"Blairdrummond safari park is much better and cheaper too.","9897":"Don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with people.","9898":"Spent a good 6 hours here and had a fabulous time with young children.","9899":"I thought it was nice to see animals in as close to their natural habitats as possible.","9900":"Don\u2019t people know animals don\u2019t go in for gardening?","9901":"The penguins seemed to be enjoying themselves in their sprinklers and the kids play areas were fab!Oh and Edinburgh is hilly?","9902":"What a shock!!!Thought it was fabulous and well worth the money.","9903":"Well done all the volunteers too","9904":"We arrived at 10:45 very professional at the start and very organised was very impressed.","9905":"We entered the park and arrived at the meerkats when we saw a Zoo presenter called Barry he gave us a talk on the Meerkats then advised us along the way which animals he was going to next we were so impressed with how clearly and passionately He spoke about the animals that we followed him around until his talks finished at about 1!!","9906":"He was so informative it was a great morning.","9907":"Well done Barry and thank you.","9908":"The staff members in the ice cream parlour at the penguins were really nice and friendly in fact all the staff were this is what great customer service is all about.","9909":"Thank you and keep up the great work","9910":"Having planned our Scottish road trip around seeing the giant pandas we were very relieved to see one outside today.","9911":"We arrived at the zoo when it opened at 10am and headed straight up the steep slope.","9912":"After reading other reviews we were concerned that we may not see many animals.","9913":"However inspite of the extreme heat, other than the lions we saw everything.","9914":"Particular favourites were the giant anteater, pygmy hippos, red river hogs, tapirs, penguins and koalas.","9915":"The entrance was a bit pricey + \u00a34 for the carpark but the variety of different animals and pleasant surroundings with spacious and thoughtful animal enclosures made this a good family day out  (with 2 boys aged 12 and 15)","9916":"Very good fun, lots of different animals to see.","9917":"The only downside is how hilly it is.","9918":"The use of train carts as decoration, without an actual train being present, was also quite misleading.","9919":"I would also like to see some public water fountains, as the weather was very warm today.","9920":"However, we spent a lot of time looking at he zebra, antelope and penguins.","9921":"These areas were very relaxing.","9922":"Good value for money.","9923":"The zoo is a wonderful place, highly priced so it's not a regular place for us.","9924":"If you are looking to pass a few hours and enjoy animals then this is great, however not always able to see all the animals, some hide, some aren't out, I don't think the enclosures are big enough for certain animals and this is hard to see and understand.","9925":"I don't know all in and out on the running of the zoo but alot could be improved.","9926":"Amazing experience we especially enjoyed the koalas,penguins,tiger,hippos,rhinos,wallabies and more.most of the animals were close by so easy to see .","9927":"There were lots of toilets around which is good especially when your with children.","9928":"The penguin parade was great .","9929":"This was a great day and experience.really recommend this.","9930":"We spent round about 7 hours here .Monkeys were amazing a highlight of the trip","9931":"We visited the zoo last September and had a dreadful visit so bad I scored the visit was 1\/5But this time was totally different the only thing we missed out on today was the pandas unfortunately","9932":"but I suppose that's life when live animals are the attraction we also visited the grassland restaurantWe had a fantastic meal there I had the chicken pie it was delicious my aunt had the ham salad she said it was lovely my wife had the pakora flat bread she thought it was nice but the flat bread was a bit dry could off done with a yogurt dip and my daughter had a cheese and","9933":"tomato pizza she said it was nice the service was really good could not complain about a thing thank you for a lovely day","9934":"My mum and me have not been to the zoo in over 6 years.","9935":"We were worried due to my Mum's mobility issues that she would not be able to go to most of the animals.","9936":"We were pleasntly suprised to find out that they have a free Mobility vehicle you can call, that allows you to access the entire Zoo.","9937":"The driver's we have experienced were extreamly helpful and very friendly, they slowed down at some exhibits to allow us to see the animals we were passing.","9938":"Every member of staff we met during the visit were helpful in showing us the safest routes for my mum to walk as she has to use crutches.","9939":"Over all I would recommend going to the Zoo!","9940":"We are both RZSS members which allows us to go any time we want for free, for a small price of \u00a35.30 a month!","9941":"So worth it!","9942":"You get great little perks like 10% of the cafes and gift shop, as well as 25% off other tickets for friends and family.","9943":"If you want to go with a person who has a disability make sure you ask for the accessibility map as it gives the number for the car!","9944":"We travelled from Ayr to Edinburgh to go to the zoo.","9945":"It was severely overpriced to get in, laid out terribly as we couldn\u2019t find our way round, we saw barely any animals and the food was really overpriced!","9946":"We left after only an hour it was so bad.","9947":"We will never be back to the zoo and we will never recommend anyone to go either.","9948":"Whats to say about a Zoo, they have animals to view and lots of behind things, concervation and breeding which by visiting helps the zoo do.with the Pandas recently moving house they didn't want to come and see us so we missed seeing them in their in-door enclosure, despit this enjoyable way to spend an afternoon.","9949":"top marks.","9950":"Amazing zoo with lots of different animal, me and my partner loved every minute of it.","9951":"Admission prices were fair and prices for feeding some of the animals was fair also!","9952":"Would recommend!","9953":"Visited the zoo to see pandas.","9954":"They are such lovely animals and I was delighted to see one for real.","9955":"The zoo is on a hill but you can get a truck up to the top.","9956":"You don't have to be fitter.","9957":"Would go again.","9958":"Cute koalas too","9959":"Visited Edinburgh Zoo 21st July.","9960":"We booked our tickets online, we were greeted at the reception, handed a map and we were informed of the timings during the day.","9961":"We headed straight to the top of the zoo then the plan was to walk down and enjoy seeing the animals.","9962":"After a very steep walk we were disappointed to read that the pandas were inside as they had recently been relocated and were adjusting to their new habitat.","9963":"We appreciate the reason but we could have been informed of this when we entered the zoo.","9964":"As previous reviews have commented the enclosures are overgrown and need tidying up.","9965":"We saw a sleeping lion, tiger and hippos, which proved difficult for our 9 year old to see, for the weeds.","9966":"The active animals were the monkeys and penguins, unfortunately the penguins didn't wish to participate in the penguin parade, but as they say never work with children or animals.","9967":"We ate lunch in the penguin cafe, which was handy for a break.","9968":"The food was ok, but over priced for what you got.","9969":"The kids selection was ok \u00a35.95 for 5 items but it has to be the smallest sandwich I've ever seen.","9970":"Really think the grounds need some TLC and tidying up, also more signage to ensure you know which way to various parts of the zoo instead of referring to the map all the time.","9971":"Also at the entrance, the gents toilet is also available for baby changing and disabled people, one toilet for everyone isn't ideal and I certainly wouldn't change a baby in the same area.","9972":"Maybe separate facilities for gents.","9973":"Paying 20 odd pound each into the zoo is fairly priced, but paying 20 pound to see very little is very disappointing.","9974":"We visited Saturday, and safe to say we were left very disappointed is an understatement.","9975":"There were actually very little animals!","9976":"Lots of enclosures closed or empty and the rest of the enclosures were so overgrown and full of weeds, even if they were occupied you wouldn\u2019t be able to see anything.","9977":"The windows (especially in the chimpanzee enclosure) were filthy, you really couldn\u2019t see the animals at all.","9978":"Now I\u2019m all for the animals, making sure enclosures are most like the wild.","9979":"But when paying into somewhere like this, you don\u2019t expect to look at weeds and nettles all day!Walking up the hill and following all the signs to only see one tiger and one lion-which both didn\u2019t move a single muscle all day.","9980":"Nothing at all to motivate the animals into moving either is such a shame.","9981":"And pandas?","9982":"Why have pandas if they\u2019re fully closed off to the public?","9983":"Why advertise about pandas when there\u2019s no possibility of seeing any?We visited the restaurant, which had a very limited menu and was very overpriced (we expect that in these types of places) to which our pizza was very tasty.","9984":"We definitely will not be returning!!!","9985":"After so much excitement following a 3 hour car journey to the zoo.","9986":"We saw more Lego creatures than live animals.","9987":"A whole day of animal sight seeing lasted a matter of minutes as their is no animals to be seen.","9988":"The highlight of the trip was watching a family member get pooped on by a bird in the picnic area 10\/10 would say a waste of money and a wasted day.","9989":"Been to this zoo a few times over many years and was excited to take my 4 year old grand daughter..","9990":"I have no words..","9991":"the enclosures are terrible.. overgrown and most of them empty.","9992":"In my opinion the zoo is so run down it should be closed down.","9993":"It has left me feeling horrible actually!","9994":"Could count how many animals we seen on both hands.","9995":"Can safely say I will never be back.","9996":"If those conditions are the best the animals can be kept in, then they shouldn't be kept.","9997":"AWFUL","9998":"Contrary to other reviews ...","9999":"we had a brilliant day out... loved the wildness  parts of the enclosures ...","10000":"animals all looked well and settled.","10001":"We didn\u2019t see the pandas but loved their new enclosure.... and understood the reasons why we didn\u2019t...","10002":"notices explaining why.","10003":"I love that the animals are not pressured as were there for penguin parade  only one penguin wanted out  but parade was called off due to lack of interest on the penguins part!!!The rainbow lorikeets were  brilliant fun... landed on heads and entertained us brilliantly...","10004":"the keepers was fab too.","10005":"All in all we had a fab day out  and would thoroughly recommendThink it would be great to see maps of \u201cyou are here \u201c just so you can get your bearings but that\u2019s just me... I need a more detailed map!!!Thank you for a great day out and love what you are doing","10006":"Myself and most of my family went to Edinburgh Zoo today and am absolutely gutted that I have come out so disappointed.","10007":"Very very little animals to see and what there was looked so miserable.","10008":"Also the zoo is very overgrown in some parts that you cannot see the animals that clear.","10009":"This was the first time we had been in about 13 years and was no where near the standards that they had back then.","10010":"Definitely not worth what we paid.","10011":"We will not be recommending this to anyone the way it is \ud83d\ude14\ud83d\ude14","10012":"We came up today and we had a good time.","10013":"We managed to see a few changes around since the last time we visited.","10014":"We managed to see most of it including climbing the top of the hill.","10015":"Some animals were hard to see as they were sleeping but all the monkeys in clousers were lovely.","10016":"Great having all that LEGO figures around the zoo and the LEGO tent.","10017":"An excellent zoo with lots to see.","10018":"Some reviews suggest the range of animals is limited, but this was not my experience.","10019":"True, some large animals are missing (e.g. elephants), but I prefer zoos to focus on species they can properly care for, and to whose conservation they can contribute.","10020":"I saw some species I had not previously seen, including Malayan tapirs and Sumatran tigers.","10021":"I also really enjoyed the monkey walk, the koalas and the large capuchin and squirrel monkey exhibit.","10022":"I do not agree that animals are difficult to see.","10023":"The enclosure are large and have a lot of foliage (which is good for the animals), but if you watch for a while you will see plenty.","10024":"Perhaps not ideal for really young children, who might not have the patience to do this, but if you want to see some more unusual animals and are willing to put in a bit of time to observe them you won't be disappointed.","10025":"The Edinburgh Zoo is a small but homey zoo that lets visitors see a variety of animals such as lions, tigers, koalas, and more.","10026":"The best part of this zoo is that they have a  Penguin Parade where the penguins will march out of their enclosure in parade format.","10027":"It is absolutely iconic!Another example of their immersive quality is that you can go into the kangaroo enclosure and get to see the beasts up close which is awesome.","10028":"Like most zoos their mission is to help conserve wildlife and to make animals lives in zoos better.","10029":"That is a mission worth pursuing and the public should support it.","10030":"Do not go to Edinburgh zoo it is over priced and scruffy.","10031":"I visited with my family of 4 and other family members and we were far from impressed with the place at \u00a321 per adult and \u00a34 to park you will also not be impressed half the animals are not even there and the ones that are look depressed and stressed the enclosures are scruffy and over grown and the interactive panels don\u2019t work.","10032":"I spoke to a member of staff about how poor the zoo was to which I was spoken rudely too and told if I\u2019m not happy I can leave.","10033":"You will also not get a refund from them I\u2019m still trying","10034":"but I don\u2019t think I\u2019ll succeed.","10035":"If you want a family fun day with animals go to blairdrummond safari park it is 100 times better and half the price.","10036":"First visit here for long time and, won`t be back.","10037":"Hardly any of the larger animals on view e.g. lion, tiger, panda, bear etc.","10038":"Saw monkeys, penquins, wallabys.","10039":"Vey poor.","10040":"When you read the reviews, I would take seriously what others say.","10041":"We went on 17th July.","10042":"Most of the enclosures are empty, We saw penguin and monkeys.","10043":"that's about it.","10044":"I am all up for providing the best and most natural habitat, but the enclosures are so overgrown you literally cannot see a thing.","10045":"It can't be educational for children because the lions, tigers and pandas are no where to be seen, so no learning done.","10046":"It wasn't a hot day so they didn't retreat indoors for the heat.","10047":"The enclosures a big which is great, but simply overgrown.","10048":"Its seriously uphill too, so be prepared for a work out.","10049":"It just got disappointing to walk up a big hill for the enclosure to be empty, again.","10050":"Very expensive and very disappointing.","10051":"Zoo is nicely kept, lush greenery and big enclosures but very few animals there to see.","10052":"Not worth the visit.","10053":"A fantastic day, conservation, education and just pure enjoyment seeing animals in as natural habitat as is possible.","10054":"A full day needed to enjoy the greatly varied animal collection.","10055":"Plenty of uphill walking but if planned prior to visit it is not too bad.","10056":"Plenty of food and drink outlets with reasonable fare.","10057":"Would suggest not a venue for very small children.","10058":"The zoo is lovely.","10059":"The animals have fantastic enclosures and seem very content.","10060":"There are some fab opportunities to get good photos of the animals.","10061":"It can however be a tiring day out because its all uphill.","10062":"I would say plan your route ahead.","10063":"The last time I visited this Edinburgh landmark was on New Year\u2019s","10064":"Day","10065":"many years ago so we were excited to revisit  with our 5 year old grandson.","10066":"Okay, we understand we can\u2019t control the visibility or whims of the animals but there were too many enclosures closed for no particular reason which impacted  negatively on any wow factor.","10067":"In the absence of animals it might have helped had the rangers offered some kind of commentary of interesting facts to compensate.","10068":"The one exception was an informed ranger at the koala pen.","10069":"Too many of the external animal cages were untidy and lacking imagination.","10070":"Shortly into the visit and our grandson was showing signs of boredom and we weren\u2019t far behind.","10071":"My wife has a chronic lung disorder so mobility was a problem with steep climbs and very narrow paths.","10072":"We couldn\u2019t help make comparison with the Blair Drummond safari park in Stirling which shines like a welcome beacon against this dreary outdated Edinburgh institution.","10073":"If you\u2019re considering a visit to this zoo think again.","10074":"At \u00a322 a head it\u2019s just not worth the admission cost.","10075":"What a disappointment this turned out to be.","10076":"\u00a350 for two adults and one child and all we managed to see were some penguins and a koala bear!","10077":"We were interested in seeing the pandas but after an extremely steep climb to their new location we saw nothing.","10078":"The zoo is not really suitable for people with mobility issues as the whole layout is on an incline and uphill.","10079":"The majority of the enclosures were empty with no animals to be seen.","10080":"I wish I had read the reviews before visiting.","10081":"Not a good day out!","10082":"Nice big plot of land, very hilly and sometimes steep, but a very inadequate animal population and overgrown landscaping - needs more animals and better maintenance - could be a very nice mid-size zoo - full of families with kids during the summer.","10083":"Adult admission near 20 pounds - not recommended at this time.","10084":"Two visits in the past week.","10085":"One on 8th July followed by 15th July.","10086":"We always enjoy visiting the Zoo but recently there have been changes going on with the pandas being moved to their new enclosure.","10087":"The new place is way bigger than the last one and looks like being a great place to watch these fantastic creatures.","10088":"I've never quite understood why some people are so against zoos.","10089":"The role they play in conservation is vital to endangered species all over the planet.","10090":"Without zoos, some of the world's greatest naturalists would never have been inspired to make documentaries raising awareness around the globe of the need to care for our animal life.","10091":"Anyway, a big thanks to Beccy at the zoo for taking the time to tell myself and my wife a little more about what's going on re the pandas and generally around Edinburgh Zoo.","10092":"She was obviously busy, (never seen a member of staff at the zoo swinging the lead) but made time to make us feel welcome and informed.","10093":"The zoo doesn't have all the animals it once did (elephants, polar bears, camels) but it does have masses of things to see and some brilliant walk-through areas that it never had back in the old days!","10094":"Walk-through areas are a fantastic way to feel like you're close up and personal with the wildlife.","10095":"There are lemurs, lorikeets, wallabies and a small monkeys walk-through available at the zoo.","10096":"One thing I've noticed is that the zoo has allowed the growth of the foliage to expand which gives a much better feel to the place and there are many plants and flowered areas to view which adds to the overall experience.","10097":"Had a really enjoyable time at Edinburgh Zoo.","10098":"I\u2019d advise allowing 3-4 hours to comfortably get around all of the exhibits.","10099":"We really enjoyed the trainer talks and found them very entertaining.","10100":"The zoo is quite hilly and spacious so I\u2019d advise wearing comfortable shoes.","10101":"For those who might struggle with the hills you can take a bus to the top of the zoo and work your way down at your own pace.","10102":"Book your tickets online in advance to save money.","10103":"Pre booked tickets don\u2019t need printed and can be displayed on your phone.","10104":"There is a car park at the zoo for those driving.","10105":"We arrived at the zoo via the 100 airport bus.","10106":"The cost of the bus was \u00a31:70 for a single journey from the city centre.","10107":"The zoo offers lockers (very reasonably priced) so it\u2019s a great idea to do this on your return journey to the airport.","10108":"Personal highlights were the penguin parade and seeing the pandas.","10109":"Lovely sunny day for walking round ,an added attraction this visit is Lego brick animals all over the Zoo .Plenty of interest shown by the younger members of our party .","10110":"A lot of enclosures closed just now with reorganisation .The","10111":"Panda enclosure has moved up to the top of the Zoo but was not open .In","10112":"fact I would say that we saw more Lego animals than real ones .The place is very busy with school buses and the keeper for a day seems to be well attended .","10113":"We have season tickets and its just as well as I see an adult ticket costs \u00a321.00 now .","10114":"The Zoo is needing to get a move on with its reorganisation and get more animals back in front of the its customers","10115":"Possibly the best zoo I've visited (though I'm not a connoisseur!)","10116":"Loved the layout, the proximity to the airport is great.","10117":"We spent around 2.5 hours at a reasonable pace and saw the majority, if we weren't stretched for time would have been much longer!","10118":"The staff are all friendly and happy to chat about the animals, and the animals appear happy and healthy.","10119":"Try to make time for this!","10120":"Great place to visit, staff as you go in to pay very friendly,helpful and informative.","10121":"Animals all looked very well looked after and the whole place is well maintained.","10122":"The lego animals were a fantastic idea  for the children and looked amazing.","10123":"I would recommend as a great day out.","10124":"Visited Edinburgh zoo today for my granddaughter's 3rd birthday.","10125":"What can I say total and utter disappointment!","10126":"\u00a319.95 for a hike up a hill, I hardly seen a single animal most of the enclosures were empty?","10127":"What's happening here Edinburgh zoo???","10128":"I used to bring my children here all the time but certainly won't be back, don't waste your money folks go to Blair drummond instead!!!","10129":"Tom was a great guide really enthusiastic, informative talks about the various animals.","10130":"Saw giant pandas too!","10131":"This is a nice zoo, not to big and u can spend about 4-5 hours in here.","10132":"They have a nice picnik area and a fun contest for kids.","10133":"Look out for penguin statues to write the right answer.","10134":"We were a bit unlucky as the Pandas were new, so it was too soon to see them.","10135":"We had a nice day.","10136":"If you want to pay 80$ to go for a hike...then you have your money`s worth...if what you want is to see animals, you`re better off going on youtube!","10137":"This zoo sucks !","10138":"We might have seen 10 animals in total... the ''walking with the lemurs...attraction had no lemurs in it !!!","10139":"You have to walk in very steep hills, not kid friendly at all !","10140":"Save your time and money!","10141":"Visited in July and happy with my visit apart from Pandas had been moved into a new exhibit and was only able to view from a distance and only if they popped outside, we was very lucky to see one.","10142":"They was the reason we travelled over 300 miles to see them.","10143":"Alot of the animals seemed to be not there.","10144":"No lions or tigers visible although we walked round twice during different times.","10145":"No red pandas to be seen along with a few other animals which was disappointing.","10146":"I have Coeliac disease and not catered for at all so left hungry after being there for 6 hours.","10147":"A good day but not as good as could have been for the price.","10148":"Edinburgh ZOO  is  heralded as the best ZOO in the UK.","10149":"Well, it is not in my opinion.","10150":"Yes, we saw cuddly kolalas in there (giant pandas were reportedly  moved to their new enclosures and they were not to be seen by public when we visited), but we have left with mixed emotions.","10151":"On a plus side \u2013 the enclosures are mostly huge and modern, the animals look -if you manage to see them - happy and the animal talks are quite informative.","10152":"On the negative \u2013 for us the ZOO is mostly aimed to be a family fun park and not a ZOO, there are many children playgrounds, restaurants etc around, whilst animal species are in fact quite limited and apart from animal talks information on animals are scarce and sometimes hard to find.","10153":"So if you are thinking of funny day with kids, its a perfect place to go, but if you are looking for informative visit, there are better places to go if you do not need to see koalas, pandas and splendid \u201epenguin rocks\u201c","10154":"I was there on Saturday, and I understand the disappointment being expressed.","10155":"People go to zoos to see animals, and there weren't that many on view.","10156":"One reason for this is that the animals have much larger enclosures than in the past, which is a very good thing, but it also means that the animals can hide away in a corner, and never be seen.","10157":"Case in point, the Sumatran tiger.","10158":"All that could be seen was a tiny, football sized patch of brown and black stripes through thick vegetation 20 yards away from the path.","10159":"I may have been the only one who saw it all day.","10160":"That said, there are also missed opportunities.","10161":"For example, there were just three zebras occupying a very large enclosure, with plenty of room for other animals, such as wildebeest, antelopes, wart hogs, buffalo etc.","10162":"They could give it a sexy name, like 'Serengeti'.","10163":"There was also a large aviary containing just one species of bird, a single snowy owl.","10164":"I'm sure they could make much better use of the space.","10165":"The zoo is quite rightly focused on conservation, and there are many critically endangered species, such as the Asiatic lion, Sumatran tiger,  giant panda, and an Indonesian pig now restricted to one small island.","10166":"However, a balance needs to be struck, and I don't think they have quite got that balance.","10167":"We went to the Zoo on a Sunday morning in early July.","10168":"Got there only to find out that the giant pandas (one of the main reasons we wanted to see the zoo) were unavailable as they were being relocated within the park.","10169":"Although we were told this information was available on the Zoo's website, it was so cleverly hidden it was almost invisible.","10170":"Many people don't realize the Zoo is located on a patch of elevated land and the pandas, tigers, lions and other large predators are located at the very top of the hill, forcing you to make a very long climb to the top.","10171":"Signs are misleading and misdirection on where you can actually view the animals is common.","10172":"Animals range from being very animated (penguins) to virtually somnolent (almost everything else).","10173":"Frankly, people were taking more pictures of the Lego structures than anything else.","10174":"Unless you have kids, I'd seriously consider avoiding this attraction.","10175":"Great day at Edinburgh Zoo disappointed we weren\u2019t able to see the Panda\u2019s, many of the enclosures were empty although the penguins were fantastic and my son loved seeing all the different monkeys and meerkats.","10176":"My main issue is why throughout the zoo is there recycling bins, notes regarding plastic waste and then in the cafe give plastic forks, plastic straws and cheese on a burger is given in a plastic tub.","10177":"A meal for 3 consisted of 10 different plastic containers, straws, cutlery, cups and bottles.","10178":"Practice what you preach","10179":"We booked our entrance tickets online, there is a discount for online bookings by the way.","10180":"We travelled to Edinburgh Zoo on a bus, from Princes Street.","10181":"It was only a couple of pounds for our bus tickets, and the journey only took 15 minutes or so.","10182":"Edinburgh Zoo is a Charity.","10183":"All of the money that they make is ploughed into caring for their resident animals and into conservation work world wide.","10184":"They highlight the importance of helping not just the larger, famous endangered species, but the small and often overlooked creatures that are nevertheless an important part of the ecosystem of our world.","10185":"Edinburgh Zoo is part of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and it shows.","10186":"The Zoo is tidy, clean and well organised.","10187":"The animals are all obviously very healthy, well cared for, and happy.","10188":"The staff are all helpful, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the animals in their care.","10189":"We spent nearly 4 hours in Edinburgh Zoo, and will definitely be going there again.","10190":"We were so very impressed by what we saw, that we voted for Edinburgh Zoo in the Scottish Charity Awards, and we sincerely hope that they win.","10191":"I personally wish that we lived in Edinburgh, as I would dearly love to join the excellent, if not exceptional team, at Edinburgh Zoo.","10192":"This is a very beautiful zoo.","10193":"Great location near the centre of Edinburgh with beautiful views everywhere.","10194":"The Panda bears are there of course and this alone makes it worth s visit.","10195":"Also it is great to see the Lorikeets especially when you have children.","10196":"You can feed them and they will sit on your arm or shoulder.","10197":"Beautiful colourful birds they are.","10198":"The animals are very well looked after and have beautiful enclosures.","10199":"Plenty of places to have some food as well.","10200":"Well worth a visit","10201":"Has a great day at the zoo very easy to get there by bus from the city center.","10202":"But do take in to consideration when going the zoo is build on the side of quite a steep hill so can be hard going.","10203":"This is our second visit to Edinburgh zoo and must say it\u2019s a great day out (especially on a nice day which we had) you can save a couple of quid buying tickets online , had a great time watching the monkeys play fighting and the youngsters tumbling about it was a very hot day so a few were asleep in the hot temperatures (if only we had that sense lol)","10204":"We weren't sure what to expect at the zoo , but it was a most enjoyable day for the family including the adults & our granddaughter certainly loved the various animals & of course the playgrounds around the whole complex.","10205":"Even though their are steep pathways around zoo complex, if you take you time you can enjoy the walks, in a lot of shaded areas with lovely trees.","10206":"We spent around 5 1\/2 hrs in the zoo and saw most of the animals, birds, penguins - which were wonderful to watch at feeding time.","10207":"Monkeys - numerous breeds, Pandas etc.Had lunch at the Penguin Cafe which was nice & food was tasty with costs reasonable as well.","10208":"Commentary by staff at several locations was very helpful and interesting to listen too.","10209":"Plenty of amenities throughout the zoo area.","10210":"Aussie Tourist.","10211":"I went to the zoo on Easter Sunday with a couple of friends.","10212":"I was visiting my friend in Edinburgh and have always wanted to go to this zoo so was very excited!!The zoo itself was lovely, although not a patch on Chester or Blackpool!","10213":"They don't have elephants or giraffes which are my two favourite animals \ud83d\ude22 they did however have pandas and koalas although they were both sleeping.","10214":"It was maybe because it was a hot day but almost all the animals were sleeping so didn't get to see much!","10215":"The penguins were my fave on the day but again they didn't want to do the parade so thought it was a bit of a wasted trip \ud83d\ude12","10216":"Phew.","10217":"Built on a steep hill.","10218":"A guide gave a super talk starting at the bottom but moved up the hill to the next so fast his audience wilted one by one.","10219":"Never a good idea to go to a zoo on a hot day.","10220":"Anything with any sense is inside and asleep which can make for a disappointing visit","10221":"We love going to zoos and Edinburgh Zoo does have its fair share of animals to look at along with loads of fascinating talks about many different animals across the day.","10222":"It is located on a very steep hill which could make it difficult for older people or those in wheelchairs but it is definitely a fun day and you could easily spend multiple hours at the place.","10223":"My only criticism comes from the prices of food and drinks within the zoo itself.","10224":"It\u2019s a bit of a captive audience and the prices are ridiculous for the amount you receive.","10225":"I would definitely recommend bringing your own food and drink to avoid having to pay the prices that they charge.","10226":"You do have to pay for parking but it is in Edinburgh so you sort of expect that.","10227":"Good bus services also run along the route and stop more or less at the entrance so it\u2019s easy to get to.","10228":"Really surprised how large the zoo was .","10229":"Impressed on how much space each resident was afforded.","10230":"Clean and an abundance of toilet facilities.","10231":"Would definitely go again.","10232":"This was the first time we had visited the zoo.","10233":"It was a great day out enjoyed by all including the teenagers of 14 and 15 years.","10234":"The only thing I would say is to look for the  que in the road as it was for the zoo","10235":"but we didn\u2019t realise so we passed it and had to turn around .Definitely","10236":"worth a visit .","10237":"We had a fantastic time at the zoo.","10238":"The staff were so friendly and the talks very informative.","10239":"There is lots to see and we felt it was a very interactive zoo.","10240":"My daughter is only 10 months old but she loves meerkats and the enclosure there is fantastic for getting up close.","10241":"We also loved the penguin parade but typically my daughter was asleep for that.","10242":"One of the best zoos we have been to.","10243":"Really enjoyed our visit.","10244":"Plenty to see even if some animals appear to have minds of their own and don\u2019t fancy putting a show on for us.","10245":"Great variety.","10246":"Confusing layout with lots of steep walks but rewarded with great view of Edinburgh.","10247":"The lion noises are teal too.","10248":"Went here on a day out when in Edinburgh for a short stay, fantastic zoo, clean  well run and Pandas!!!!!","10249":"Great zoo.","10250":"Views from the very top are fab!","10251":"But worth climbing.","10252":"Some areas are very steep.","10253":"Plenty of places to rest.","10254":"Koalas are adorable.. the penguins even come out and do a circle lap around us.","10255":"I went to Edinburgh zoo under a month ago .","10256":"I used to go when I was a child and I absolutely loved it and I was excited to revisit.","10257":"I was very disappointed.","10258":"This zoo is not safe for children, I saw people smoking marijuana and drinking alcohol, children getting injured on the play equipment, drinking water cost over \u00a31 , and the there was litter everywhere .","10259":"The animal enclosures are not big enough, they need more enrichment for the animals , some of the animals such as the big cats were pacing constantly which is a sign of agitation.","10260":"The penguin enclosure was FILTHY, and Smelt Foul.","10261":"I could not spend longer than two minutes at the penguin exhibit as a result of this .This attraction isn\u2019t very accessible for people with mobility issues as the whole zoo is situated on a hill and there\u2019s a lot of walking to each various attraction.","10262":"They offer manual wheelchairs however they really need electric ones because pushing yourself uphill all day long would be very tiring and possibly cause physical injury.","10263":"I saw the meerkats and they were fighting constantly, and most of the penguins looked very unhappy .","10264":"The main issue I have with this place is the overall cleanliness and the welfare of the animals .","10265":"I\u2019ve been to many zoos in my life across the UK and this one is one of the worst I\u2019ve been to and that\u2019s saying something!","10266":"First time visiting after 30years.","10267":"To start with (the parking area )with someone taking cash as you go through to park,this has never changed in 30 years\ud83d\ude44","10268":"Small number of species on show,with limited and overgrown enclosures,, given that they need some (wild areas)Also rubbish and rats seen in some of these areas.","10269":"One enclosure which used to house the polar bear has now got LEGO penguins.","10270":"Lots of empty overgrown enclosures,broken down vehicles equipment etc as well as the broken train that used to take visitors up around the steep areas of the zoo if needed.","10271":"Toilets needed refurbished,a bit smelly to say the least.","10272":"Restaurants well over priced,a shame to rip people off after they have payed a lot to enter in the first place.","10273":"All in all didn\u2019t think this zoo was worth the entry fee and some major changes are needed\ud83d\ude22","10274":"I was really looking forward to a day at the zoo and I am gutted to say I was so disappointed.","10275":"Firstly it was ridiculously hilly, not suitable for anyone who is pushing pushchairs and even small kids who like to walk....","10276":"it was too much!","10277":"The lions and tigers are right at the top, so we \u2018climbed\u2019 up the steep hills....","10278":"and we saw nothing.","10279":"Not one tiger or lion to be seen!","10280":"Gutted!We saw the penguin parade, that was cute.","10281":"Staff were lovely.","10282":"Hardly saw any animals attall (I could count on my hand how many we saw)No animals in the walkthroughsNo giraffes or elephantsLayout was confusingExhibits were all overgrownSaw","10283":"no zoo keepersLimited cafes \/restaurantsI have been to MUCH better zoos!","10284":"SO underwhelming and will not going back which is a shame \ud83d\ude1e","10285":"Great zoo with species that you don\u2019t often find at other zoos.","10286":"The pandas were the obvious highlight and the main reason we went.","10287":"But the rest of the zoo was also great with a huge penguin enclosure and a chance to walk with the wallabies.","10288":"The zoo is on a hill which could be a bit of an issue for some people but the staff were very friendly and would help you if you needed it!","10289":"We visited the Zoo while in town and had a wonderful day.","10290":"It is well laid out and the zoo keepers seem to really care about the animals.","10291":"It is steep but if you are at least average fit it is no problem.","10292":"Also if you pace yourself and plan you only have to go uphill a few times.","10293":"The Chimpanzee exhibit is top notch but the stars of the show were the parading penguins.","10294":"People line up around a circle walk way and the keepers open the exhibit door and the penguins that are so inclined walk the path between the crowds then back into their habitat.","10295":"They explained it happened as an accident in the 1950s and now it has become a tradition.","10296":"It is the most fun thing we have ever witnessed at a zoo.","10297":"Ask what time the days parade is when you buy your ticket.","10298":"It is roughly 20 pounds per adult and well worth the price.","10299":"Also the views from the top of the hill are magnificent.","10300":"We are so glad we spent our afternoon here!","10301":"An enjoyable day out with the animal displays well laid out.","10302":"The panda and penguins are both definitely worth visiting.","10303":"We were first in , bought our tickets online which I recommend.","10304":"We walked to the Hilltop which is not recommended for anybody a little unfit or who doesn't enjoy a beating!","10305":"We saw very few animals at the top and noticed lots of overgrown nettles\/weeds in the public viewing areas which was disappointing.","10306":"On the whole we were all expecting much more, our son was upset as there were few animals there compared to other zoos in the UK.","10307":"Not for us I am afraid.","10308":"I have visited many times over the years from my own childhood, taking my children and as a teacher on a school visit and it never disappoints.","10309":"The zoo has something for everyone.","10310":"The important thing to bring with you is time.","10311":"Time to \u2018stand and stare \u2018 and enjoy the wonders of nature.","10312":"Why would you want to rush the natural world, you can learn so much.","10313":"We took our daughter to Edinburgh Zoo to celebrate her 3rd birthday and were hugely disappointed.","10314":"A lot of empty enclosures, we didn't see any tigers or lions and neither did anyone else I asked.","10315":"There was no animals in any if the walkthrough sections either, a lot if signs up that areas were moved renovated and enclosures temporarily closed but there was no notice informing this when we paid for entry and charged full price.","10316":"The food in the restaurant was lovely but very expensive.","10317":"Another thing they need to sort is the lack of information boards, zoos usually have signs up telling the animals names and some information about them but other than the kaola and panda bears there was none.","10318":"We wont be going back, much prefer the five sisters zoo, better value for a family day out.","10319":"We enjoyed seeing the pandas, tigers, lion, vicunas, birds, penguins, monkeys, chimpanzees and more.","10320":"We found the zoo to be nicely planned out.","10321":"The zoo looks like they care about the animals and the environments that they are in.","10322":"We recommend this experience to people who enjoy visiting zoos.","10323":"Day trip out with my boyfriend as been wanting to see the pandas for a while!","10324":"This zoo is a good size to walk round as it\u2019s not too big but still large enough for hours worth of fun!","10325":"Lots of variety of animals, some interactive aspects which is good for children.","10326":"very good value for money.","10327":"Busses located directly outside too and not far from the city centre.","10328":"Went for a visit with an 18 month old.","10329":"The biggest selling point of the Zoo is the range and variety of Animals, some of them like the Panda are very rare.","10330":"We did enjoy getting to see the Panda and particularly enjoyed seeing all the Penguins including some new chicks.","10331":"A warning, it is on the side of a steep hill so not the easiest day pushing a pushchair up and around.","10332":"The weather was not good and there were plenty of indoor exhibits.","10333":"Even on a cold wet day there were a lot of people there and it was difficult to find seats in the eating establishments.","10334":"Some of the exhibits looked a bit tired and in need of a little TLC, particularly the lion.","10335":"Although there were a number of ongoing refurbishment excerises so this appears to be being addressed.","10336":"All in all we had a good day and would visit again if we were in the area.","10337":"it was lovely to see the animals had plenty of space and very nice to see such a variety.","10338":"a definite whole day experience.","10339":"very nice that the city centre bus stop is right outside.zoos are never my favourite places, but I appreciate there is an element of conservation to what they do.","10340":"I have to say that Edinburgh zoo is one of the best I have visited.it does cover a large area so be prepared for plenty of walking, some of it up quite steep hills.","10341":"however the views are worth the walk.","10342":"I visited  the Zoo expressly with the purpose  of seeing  the Pandas.","10343":"I got to the Zoo entrance before  opening  hours  and there  was only a small queue at the main entrance.","10344":"Although  the Zoo opened at 10 the Pandas exhibit  was not open  until  half an hour later.","10345":"The information  should  have been  made available  on the website.","10346":"The monkey house was still being cleaned as I visited.","10347":"I  also saw the Penguins  who were porpoising in their large enclosure.","10348":"The tigers were not on show as a new companion had been  found for the existing  one.","10349":"Food in the cafe was average.","10350":"The zoo's  gift shop was excellent  with plenty of panda related  souvenirs.","10351":"I  didn't  have time nor the energy to visit all the animals since the zoo is on a hill.","10352":"At under \u00a320 admission, the Zoo is cheaper than the London  ZSL sites for which I have membership.","10353":"Good  value, especially  in Spring.","10354":"This is a great place to visit, we were lucky enough to see almost all of the animals.","10355":"There is a large variety of animals so there should be something for everyone.","10356":"The site is spread over a large hill and as well as seeing the animals at the top of the park it is worth climbing to the top for some great views over Edinburgh.","10357":"Allow at least half a day to see all round the park, longer if you want to see all the talks, feeds and penguin parade.","10358":"Let\u2019s get the negative out of the way first.....","10359":"It\u2019s on a hill... and there is walking, but the zoo do offer help for those who would need it.","10360":"Ok now that\u2019s done with....","10361":"what can I say about this zoo, I was blown away with it, the animal enclosures are more than enough and the best ones I have seen for zoo animals.","10362":"We regularly go to Paignton zoo and living coasts and have also been to Chester but Edinburgh is on par with Chester.","10363":"The prices for this zoo are very good and well worth the money if buying on the day or advance.","10364":"You can see that the zoo is putting a lot of effort in terms of animal care and improving the zoo.","10365":"Great day out together or for the family.","10366":"Very clean zoo and the animals had rather large enclosures so made for an exciting trip!","10367":"Home to the only Giant Panda's in the UK, they seemed to be the main attraction for many visitors and they did not disappoint ;)","10368":"Other animals included penguins, lions, a monkey walkthrough and tigers!","10369":"We never got to see the pandas as they were hiding.","10370":"More signs would be helpful to find your way around.","10371":"The daily talks are very good we wnet to a few of them.","10372":"The staff in the restaurant are terrible, took about 24 min for them to take are order, they took tables that arrived after us orded 1st, staff where standing by the till talking when orders where needed taken.","10373":"The food was OK and arrived quickly after ordering.","10374":"All the little ice cream\/juice huts where closed.","10375":"Would be 5 stars if it wasn't for the restaurant","10376":"Visited over the weekend on our trip to Edinburgh, it is a few miles out of the city but its easy to access, numerous buses pass it.","10377":"We went for 10am when it opened as we hadnt booked tickets, there was a bit of a que but only took about 5 mins to get in.","10378":"Nice selection of animals and they do talks throughout the day.","10379":"You can bring your own picnic in and there are 3 different places to get food from.","10380":"I need gluten free and we asked in the restaurant and i was offered either soup and roll or the kids meal of fish fingers, chips and beans in an adult size, i know some people get picky over there not been loads of options","10381":"but i was just happy to have something i could have","10382":"Quality zoo with animals clearly well looked after with really friendly staff.","10383":"Janet in the gift shop was brilliant and ended the visit off so well.","10384":"Would definitely reccomend great zoo despite the hills.","10385":"We even got to see the pandas too!","10386":"Tucked away somewhere you wouldn\u2019t expect, Edinburgh Zoo really is a lovely little day trip.","10387":"All the animals are obviously well cared for, the enclosures seem adequate and the keepers are knowledge and happy to answer questions.","10388":"Plenty of food places in the centre of the zoo - if you don\u2019t want to pay extra, bring your own food.","10389":"All zoo\u2019s and wildlife parks are expensive to eat at!","10390":"However we avoided the usual greasy food by visiting the cafe and had some sandwiches which turned out to be pretty tasty and good quality.","10391":"Things I can recommend -Feeding the Lorikeets: I\u2019m not sure how often or when they do this as it wasn\u2019t offered the first time I visited in 2017, but if they mention it at the reception, definitely go for it!","10392":"You can buy a dinky pot of nectar for \u00a31 from the keepers inside the enclosure which is totally worth it just purely because we ended up all 4 of us with birds on our heads and arms and got great photos!The Penguin parade:","10393":"Basically the keepers release some of the gentoo penguins and walk them around a pathway using visitors as a human wall.","10394":"Keep little kids in your arms or buggies as the penguins are known to be a bit nippy or steal\/bite items, inc phones!The Pandas: Most people in the UK have never seen a real life Panda, so Edinburgh Zoo is the place to go for this!","10395":"We arrived the day before they were being moved to their new and huge enclosure, I\u2019ll have to go back when it\u2019s finished to check it out but it looked awesome from the glimpse we saw while walking around.","10396":"One mention, the zoo is built on a big hill that flattens out for the middle section (kids play area and food places).","10397":"Expect to have achy legs by the end of the day and bring a pushchair for smaller children!","10398":"It was the worst zoo that I had visited, I went there with a family there were a few animals, the animal seemed to be unhappy and nonchalant, we were hungry couldn't find anything to eat.","10399":"Overpriced & absolutely wasted money Not recommended it!","10400":"We were visiting Edinburgh and got the bus to the zoo which was perfect as it stops directly outside.","10401":"The zoo is quite hilly and we had a pushchair but we didn\u2019t have any access issues to see any animals.","10402":"We were delighted to see the beautiful panda and also the baby koala with its mum.","10403":"We spent around 5 hours looking at all the animals, this was one of the best for visibility of seeing animals, the only animal we didn\u2019t see was the rhino.","10404":"We would definitely recommend visiting, we had a great day out.","10405":"Not a massive zoo but really easy to get to with the bus stopping right outside.","10406":"All the animals seem happy and well looked after.","10407":"Definitely worth a visit.","10408":"We visited whilst up in Edinburgh for a family break.","10409":"We had a great day.","10410":"The penguin parade is a must,  as is the feeding of the tropical birds with nectar.","10411":"The Pandas are a must.","10412":"It is worth organising your visits in time with the keeper talks,  as they were all engaging and informative , we listened to the penguin,  rhino and Chimpanzees talks.","10413":"Yes it's not the biggest zoo and there were some empty areas.","10414":"Also the big cats were in hiding.","10415":"But the whole place was clean,  lots of amenities and plenty to keep a family entertained for a day out.","10416":"I had a great day out last week at Edinburgh zoo .","10417":"One thing to be aware of is that the zoo is built into the side of a hill so its uphill for 3\/4 of the zoo and down hill for the last part to the Rhinos and Pandas .","10418":"Entry price is \u00a317.95 for adults + \u00a39.00 for kids online.","10419":"I was lucky to be able to go when all the kids were at school and mid - week so it was very quiet and had good views of all the animals .","10420":"I spent 5 hours at the zoo seeing all the animals.","10421":"The penguins are a great stop off and watch and also includes a feeding session if you are there at the right time .The gift shop is large but expensive .","10422":"You don't have to leave via the gift shop which is the norm at most places as another exit is available to the right of the shop onto the main road.","10423":"The zoo is located 2 miles from Haymarket station and can be walked to by staying on the main road with the zoo being on the right hand side of the road .Lots of buses pass the zoo and are currently (June 2019) charging \u00a33.60 for two adult single tickets .","10424":"Its a nice walk if the sun is shining .I would definitely visit again .","10425":"Dissappointed dissappointed.","10426":"So so annoyed what a waste of money.","10427":"Wish I had read reviews 1st.","10428":"Certainly would not have wasted my hard earned money","10429":"Except the koala, the giant panda and the penguins, nothing i could find attractive especially if I consider the entry fee.","10430":"Penguin parade is a must watch thing.","10431":"Check the timing and plan the visit accordingly.","10432":"Better paying for five sisters zoo, was raining hardly any animals out and most enclosures empty, not worth the money and restaurants are expensive and unorganised.","10433":"Nearly \u00a33 for a bacon roll.","10434":"Not going again.","10435":"What a brilliant zoo!","10436":"It\u2019s all uphill but it\u2019s well worth it.","10437":"From pandas to warty pigs the zoo has a great variety of animals to see and most were out and about on our visit to the zoo.","10438":"We particularly enjoyed seeing the pandas and the very funny monkey house.","10439":"You can see the keepers really care about the animals here and they seem very content in their environment.","10440":"Especially the panda who was snoring away!Wouldn\u2019t recommend the cafe as the sandwiches were dry and it was grubby with cobwebs sadly","10441":"Visited with 6 adults and 5 children who were in Edinburgh on holiday.","10442":"We spent 6 hours there and didn\u2019t see everything.","10443":"Very interesting to see all the animals and read the information boards.","10444":"Children also enjoyed the play areas.","10445":"Food and service in restaurant was excellant.","10446":"We knew Edinburgh was hilly but wasn't quite prepared for how steep the hill was at the zoo.","10447":"I am 7 months pregnant but was able to make it around without too much issue.","10448":"There is plenty of seating around so you can take lots of breaks.","10449":"Many of the exhibits were empty due to refurbishment and, due to the windy weather, some of the animals were hiding - but was expected for Scottish weather!!","10450":"There was still plenty of animals to see and we had an enjoyable time.","10451":"My only crisitism is that toilets were few and far between.","10452":"We arrived when the park opened at 10am and left at 16:30.","10453":"The zoo is one of the best we\u2019ve been to in regards to getting up close to animals as well as very interesting and informative talks.","10454":"I\u2019m not sure what it is like at peak times, but we visited off-peak on a very rainy Wednesday.","10455":"We saw the majority of the animals, mostly up close and clearly (the lion decided he wanted to remain anonymous, fair enough).","10456":"Some enclosures were closed because of veterinarian requirements, animal moves or enclosure improvements but this was very minimal and didn\u2019t ruin our day (there was definitely enough going on to keep us entertained).","10457":"The new Panda enclosure is currently being built and looks like it will be amazing once finished.","10458":"We feel the food is fairly priced and on par with all other attractions we have visited and eaten at (for 2 hot meals and 2 soft drinks approx.","10459":"\u00a323\/24).","10460":"We thought the quality of the food was good as well.","10461":"There\u2019s no harm in bringing a picnic if you prefer.","10462":"One caution is that it\u2019s very hilly and even with us being perfectly ambulant, struggled getting up the hills towards the end.","10463":"I could go on, but basically I strongly recommend a visit.","10464":"A thoroughly enjoyable day even if it was raining for most of the day.","10465":"Been to Edinburgh zoo twice now and never had a problem.","10466":"I would strongly advise wearing comfortable shoes as it is ALL up hill","10467":"and I mean steep.","10468":"There aren't a huge amount of toilet facilities so make sure to go when near a cafe.","10469":"The amount of animals isn't as much as other zoos but it is still a great day out.","10470":"The new lorikeet enclosure you can walk in is amazing.","10471":"At one point we had 6 lorikeet runing up and down our arms.","10472":"If I were to put a value on each of the species of animals we saw for our 50\u00a3 admission it would work out to about 10\u00a3 for each species!","10473":"I have never been so disappointed by the lack of animals but my disappointment was nothing to that of our 3 1\/2 year old granddaughter \u2639\ufe0f","10474":"The viewing quite often was not geared to younger children along with toilet facilities and multiple other areas.","10475":"Great you want to help protect so many animals but it doesn\u2019t work on the younger generations if they can\u2019t see what they\u2019re trying to protect.","10476":"Also the signage was as scarce as the animals.","10477":"We felt it could hardly be classified as a zoo, Blair Drummond was much more child friendly!","10478":"Fantastic trip to the zoo with family.","10479":"My grandaughter who is 8 wanted to see the Panda's for her 9th birthday and what a delight they were to see.","10480":"Made the trip worthwhile.","10481":"My grandson liked the meerkats.","10482":"The zoo has somethings for everyone,it is very hilly so if you have disabilities make use of the transport.","10483":"All the staff at the zoo where friendly and helpful.","10484":"I would definitely visit again","10485":"Great day here to be had, I didn't capture enough on pics, the whole zoo is brilliant.","10486":"Well worth a visit, book online it's a bit cheaper.","10487":"The zoo website is really quick and easy to use to pre book tickets.","10488":"Staff are really helpful, tell you what happening at what time so you dont miss it.","10489":"Both my children loved it, spend the day there.","10490":"We got the bus from the city centre and it was quick and easy to find.","10491":"The zoo is very large and takes quite a while to explore fully.","10492":"The range of animals is good and the koalas and pandas were a real draw.","10493":"It was a wet day so many animals were sheltering but we saw most of them.","10494":"The newer enclosures were impressive and there were plenty of staff members around to answer questions.","10495":"Well worth the visit.","10496":"Visited with two under 5's who had a great time - lots of play areas for them to use.","10497":"Some building going on, so some understandable disruption.","10498":"But, many unaffected areas appeared tired and a little shabby.","10499":"A clear drop in standards since our last visit about 4 years ago.","10500":"Visited the zoo for just a few hours, as I was in the city for a work meeting and had time to kill before travelling home.","10501":"Decided to visit the zoo mainly for the Penguins (I am a massive penguin fan) so spent most of my time at Penguin rock, which is amazing, Loved seeing the Kings, Rockhoppers and Gentoos and also getting to see the penguin parade.","10502":"Lovely big area for the birds, with plenty of pool space and lots of room to view them and get quite close (which is great for me).I did have a wander round some of the other exhibits too and saw the Pandas, Chimps, Rhino's, wallabies and quite a few others (didn't have enough time to get round it all though).","10503":"I have to be honest, I'm not a big zoo fan (especially when the big animals are in them) and some of the enclosures e.g. the Rhinos did seem quite small for such large animals but I am sure they are well cared for (nothing to make me think they weren't) and happy.","10504":"The penguin area though was well worth the visit for me, absolutely loved it and being as that was the reason I visited, it was definitely worth while.","10505":"I would definitely go again, if just for penguin rocks but would also like more time to see the rest of the zoo.","10506":"Visited midweek to see the pandas which we did see but ... ...","10507":"here goes!","10508":"We booked tickets online yet still queued for at least 20 mins to get in it was a totally chaotic system and not even weekend\/ school holidays.","10509":"Toilet facilities inside and outside zoo are inadequate - too few toilets, very tiny (and I\u2019m only small) and in need of a refurb.","10510":"All animal enclosures looked awful and in need of major attention (the Sun Bear enclosure looked like a junk yard).","10511":"Whilst not expecting to see every animal we became concerned that not even the zoo keepers (not that we saw any whilst we were there) would know where the big cats were hiding and the enclosures did not seem that secure - we made a hasty retreat from this area!","10512":"The play parks were ok but no food outlets were open.","10513":"The final straw was visiting the exotic bird house where we saw what we believe to be rats on the floor of the enclosure (lots of them scurrying about).","10514":"It was at this point we decided to leave after only 2 hours - the children aged 14 and 8 didn\u2019t disagree.","10515":"We have visited  Chester zoo numerous times and other wildlife parks across the uk and the last decade - this is the worst one by far and we won\u2019t ever go back.","10516":"I was shocked by the lack of upkeep around the zoo.","10517":"It was the cheapest - now I know why!","10518":"Please give this one a swerve and hopefully the animals we be relocated to other parks!","10519":"So many animals to see.","10520":"We were there for a good 3-4 hours and maybe missed two animals.","10521":"It was so interesting to see the different animals that we would never see where we live.","10522":"There are little cafes there and a restaurant.","10523":"The restaurant didn't have regular food that we were used to so we just got snacks along the way.","10524":"The animal exhibits were layed out so well and it looked like they had a put a lot of work into them.","10525":"A little pricey to get in but with the amount of animals to see, it made sense.","10526":"Very impressed and would highly recommend.","10527":"Visited the zoo on the 23rd May and had a great day.","10528":"2 year old son loved seeing all the animals and there were plenty of play parks to keep him busy in between.","10529":"The panders and penguins were our favourites.","10530":"Be sure to watch the penguin parade :)","10531":"Edinburgh ZooWe are in Edinburgh as a family of 4 (2 parents, one 13 year old and disabled grandparent).It is often an ethical decision (for us) of wether to attend Zoos, but on this occasion we decided that we would be most unlikely to see a giant panda \ud83d\udc3c any other way - so purely on this basis we decided to visit.","10532":"We had researched and knew that the  geography of the zoo would make it very challenging for Mom to get around in her mobility scooter due to the steep paths and stairs.","10533":"However we decided to gamble on it knowing we could use the Zoo\u2019s wheelchair transportation car if necessary.","10534":"Entry for the zoo is not in anyway value for money but it was less painful than it could have been because one of our party ( career for a disabled guest) has free entry.","10535":"Initial toilet facilities just inside zoo  - these were inadequate for the volume of visitors e.g one loo for men and no urinal!","10536":"They need updated and more regular cleaning!The enclosures - many appeared empty and overgrown and some possibly a little small.","10537":"With the exception of play areas (which younger kids were clearly enjoying!)","10538":"the zoo looked very tired and felt unloved and a bit sad.","10539":"We were very disappointed.","10540":"We decided to focus our visit on the koalas and pandas as my daughter and mom had  never seen them in real life before.","10541":"The koala enclosure was good and of a more modern style and standard.","10542":"We were lucky to enough to spot them - both asleep as was to be expected.","10543":"The pandas \ud83d\udc3c- we are aware that a new enclosure is being made and that this review is not based on that.","10544":"Both pandas were indoors - one fast asleep upside down covered in bamboo.","10545":"The other panda came in whilst we were there and we were alone for a few mins with her before the crowds came in.","10546":"It was wonderful to see her(?)","10547":"she was active and enjoyed a carrot and another snack.","10548":"She looked full full of life and character.","10549":"Would have liked to have heard a talk about them or take a leaflet etc - nothing like that was available.","10550":"There is plenty of viewing space although it did get very very busy!","10551":"I was glad to be at the front as negotiating mom back through the crowd was challenging.","10552":"In summary the zoo trip was disappointing we would be very unlikely to return and feel it was overpriced with no return again scheme for the ticket price.","10553":"However seeing the pandas made up for what would have otherwise have been a rather disappointing and expensive trip.","10554":"Plenty of animals and very clean.","10555":"The animals here are very looked after.","10556":"Staff are friendly and helpful and the Grasslands Restaurant located on the premises is absolutely fantastic!","10557":"We came here to break up a few days of sight seeing.","10558":"Easily reached by bus from the centre.","10559":"Book tickets online for a cheaper price.","10560":"Wonderful views from the zoo.","10561":"Incredible gardens as well as modern and well kept enclosures.","10562":"The children also really enjoyed the play parks.","10563":"Picnic pots with amazing views at top of the park.","10564":"Great day!","10565":"What an experience to see Panda's & Koala Bears in this country!!","10566":"All the animals were clearly well cared for & the zoo in general is of a high standard.","10567":"The penguin march is also a highlight during the day when their enclosure is opened & they at their free will can come out & walk around the public area.","10568":"I would highly recommend a visit here","10569":"Let's be realistic for a second: you're in Scotland and at a zoo.","10570":"If it isn't raining then you're more likely to see some animals as they, funnily enough, dont care how much you paid to get in; they don't like rain.","10571":"That being said, we went on a 'random showers' day so we saw quite alot.","10572":"The penguins were fab, the chimp house was great, rhinos were haivng a love\/hate match and we deeply enjoyed the socialable drill.","10573":"My only complaint was that the food establishments were not all open, I assume because it isn't quite the busy season.","10574":"Perhaps some more covered eating areas and a vending machine would be an idea?","10575":"Firstly all the people who say its hilly are correct it is.","10576":"But we carried on we went to see the pandas and got to see them .i dont know","10577":"why but thought they were bigger but theylooked well looked after saw the female lion not the male.lots of empty cages.and the rain didnt help.would go back to see the pandas","10578":"We\u2019ve been coming here for years and still enjoy it.","10579":"We bought tickets online and got a pretty good deal.","10580":"We got there early and parking was easy.","10581":"There was a good range of animals from the panda to the rhino.","10582":"The Budongo project for the monkeys was also very good.","10583":"Plenty of places to relax or eat and the penguin parade was still good too.","10584":"Excellent Zoo with good staff, a wide range of animals, plenty of indoor areas for when it inevitably rains, and lots of talks and educational sections.","10585":"Animals clearly well cared for, and there is a lot to make clear how endangered some of the species are.","10586":"Bring a picnic and plenty of drinks.","10587":"We came here largely to see the pandas and koalas and that part didn\u2019t disappoint - both animals were on show and very visible to the public which was lovely to see!The zoo is very hilly and steep to walk up so is not for those with limited mobility\/accompanying wheelchairs and pushchairs.","10588":"Most of the walkthroughs (one thing we were looking forward to) were closed, and many of the enclosures were empty.","10589":"I love tigers so was looking forward to seeing those, but was informed by a staff member their enclosure was closed to the public after one of the tigers sadly passed away last week.","10590":"We decided to chance it anyway and found it was open to the public after all!","10591":"That seemed a recurring theme, with the staff members not being very knowledgable or helpful.","10592":"Would definitely recommend seeing the penguin parade, pandas and koalas as this definitely makes the zoo unique from others but other than that, there wasn\u2019t a lot to shout about.","10593":"I live near Colchester Zoo and in contrast Edinburgh Zoo is nowhere near as good.","10594":"My wife and I travelled up from the Midlands with our 5 year old son for several days stay in Edinburgh.","10595":"Whilst there we took our son to visit the zoo, he enjoyed it and seemed to be quite happy.","10596":"Having previously visited Chester Zoo, I have to say my wife and I found Edinburgh Zoo quite disappointing, lots of empty enclosures and maintenance work being carried out, we had seen everything there was to see in around 3-4 hours.","10597":"We'd definitely visit Edinburgh again, however we'd probably give the zoo a miss, there are much better things to see and do in Edinburgh.","10598":"The animal enclosures where good, loved penguin rock and fun play area for the kids.","10599":"My highlight was the pandas.","10600":"The chimpanzee enclosure was good, very active animals.","10601":"Great for kids and adults, would go back again.","10602":"Gift shop is very expensive","10603":"A lovely zoo with friendly and knowledgeable keepers.","10604":"I would recommend catching as many of the talks as possible so an early arrival is best.","10605":"Note that it's all uphill  (like Dudley zoo) so make sure you are ready for it.","10606":"A lovely zoo with lots of different animals.","10607":"We loved the pandas and koalas, nice to see something different.","10608":"It\u2019s on a very steep hill so not ideal for those with limited mobility.","10609":"Our little one loved exploring the grounds.","10610":"It was nice a quiet when went so it was easy to see the animals without any crowds.","10611":"The penguin walk was very entertaining.","10612":"This was our first visit to Edinburgh Zoo which was to specifically see the Pandas.","10613":"They did not disappoint as the male was awake and out in his enclosure which was ab amazing treat.","10614":"The zoo is compact and well presented.","10615":"It is set on a hill so be prepared for the uphill walking.","10616":"It has a natural woodland feel to it built around established trees and the enclosures blend in with the surroundings.","10617":"There are gorgeous views from the top.","10618":"There is a good variety of animals for the size and location of the zoo.","10619":"I loved the sun bear!","10620":"He was playful.","10621":"The food area is plentiful and so are the outdoor eating areas.","10622":"There were play areas and an education centre for young children too.","10623":"A great venue near a gorgeous city","10624":"To start ,it looked exciting and then was disappointed overall.","10625":"It was an average fair.","10626":"The terrain has got few climbs ( bit steep).","10627":"By the time we reached the Zebra enclosure and the big cats, we were dead tired.","10628":"Not much happened at the Hippo feeding as they were in no mood to listen.","10629":"Tough luck on us.","10630":"Penguin parade was good.","10631":"Many of the enclosures were closed.","10632":"Most of the active ones were monkey related.","10633":"Good ones.","10634":"Parrot feeding appeared commercial.","10635":"Most of them keep on feeding them for 1 pound.","10636":"Cafes were closed except a couple at the Penguin parade(near the entrance).","10637":"It was difficult to spot few of the birds\/animals  .","10638":"We weren't sure if they were around or we missed them.","10639":"More of walking and less of animals\/birds.","10640":"Thats my feeling.","10641":"They need to work on the facility more and make it world class.","10642":"There is space .Needs","10643":"a bit of attention.","10644":"This is a fantastic facility and we had a good day out with young children.","10645":"The penguins and rhinos were a particular hit and the park areas which broke up the day are a good addition.","10646":"We visited on a bank holiday when rain was forecast and although there was a little rain it was mostly dry, warm and quite sunny at points.","10647":"One aspect which was frustrating was that most of the drinks\/food vendor stalls which were shown on the map were closed, apart from the main cafes and restaurant.","10648":"We had promised the kids an ice cream as incentive to walk up part of the hill but couldn\u2019t find an open vendor so had to go back down again.","10649":"The kids are very young so by the time we had done that, it was too much for them to walk back up to see the rest of the animals which was a shame.","10650":"The place was pretty busy and it seemed like a missed opportunity not to have these open as it looked like there were definitely enough people to justify it.","10651":"Also, more large maps and sign posts would be helpful.","10652":"Overall the day was a success.","10653":"Incredible day we arrived at 10am for opening and left just after 4pm we didn\u2019t really stop so much to see and do.","10654":"You must be fit and able as some good climbs to see all the activities.","10655":"Everyone we met was friendly and helpful especially the volunteers.","10656":"Barry gave some excellent knowledge with good humour at the talks.","10657":"Truly great day out.","10658":"We entered at opening and left at closing.","10659":"Monies worth I have to say certainly.","10660":"The weather better than expected but can\u2019t control that.","10661":"We came for the giant panda and wasn\u2019t disappointed.","10662":"The talks perfect and informative the animals although some more secretive than others were out.","10663":"Worth going just to hear Barry.","10664":"His insights and histories are a credit to the zoo.","10665":"More than just a zoo hell yes.","10666":"Came here by bus from city centre ( 10 minutes journey) lovely day out, fun watching the penguin parade!","10667":"Brilliant.","10668":"Listened to the tiger talk... brilliant guy who explained really well whats going on not just with Edinburgh but in the world with tigers.","10669":"Did notice the black bear twitching as the electric fence seemed to be making a loud crackling noise (seemed broken )","10670":"so i and others found it hard to watch, the bear seemed in distress ( noted that it had more than enough room to walk away and absolutely beautiful with amazing staff ) but it seemed bothered and kept looking at the fence trying to get near it and twitching everytime it crackled...any explanation would be great as i know nothing about bears \ud83d\ude00.","10671":"Overall will be back this year.","10672":"We were disappointed as our visit was very expensive yet we saw very few animals as many enclosures were closed or the animals appeared to be absent.","10673":"Our daughter particularly loves insects but there were very few.","10674":"Edinburgh Zoo is fantastic.","10675":"From the penguins to the koalas, it is a fabulous place to visit.","10676":"Hours of fun for all the family.","10677":"Worth every penny of the entrance fee.","10678":"The new panda enclosure is going to be spectacular, can't wait to go back to see it.","10679":"I loved it all, especially the bears!!","10680":"Admission is possibly a little over-priced, but with vouchers and opting out of the voluntary donation you can get admission down to around \u00a316 per person, which seems to be the going rate for most attractions in Edinburgh.","10681":"However, you can easily spend a whole day here - in fact you probably won't see much if you don't!","10682":"The pandas were amazing as were the koalas and the various 'walkthroughs' which allow you 'up close and personal' access to the animals.","10683":"Some parts are hilly so bear this in mind if walking is an issue.","10684":"Penguin parade was something of an anti-climax but something a bit different I guess.","10685":"Last time I visited Edinburgh zoo","10686":"I was very disappointed and actually put off visiting againSince last time a lot of stuff has changed for the better!Seems to be a lot cleaner for a start!All the animals seem quite happy in there areas, lots to see, one problem I found was trying to find certain animals!","10687":"I still haven\u2019t found the Pygmy hippo and it took most of the day to find out how to get to see the pandas!","10688":"Although that could just be meAdvice I would give is defiantly bring your own food, they have picnic areas for you, we went in to the grasslands restaurant and it was over \u00a320 for a kids pizza and a plate of chips!","10689":"Which I found expensive but there wasn\u2019t much choice!Penguins are a good see!","10690":"Plenty of photo ops with loads of animals!Lots of walking and mostly uphill!","10691":"Plenty of animals.","10692":"Penguin parade is great to watch.","10693":"Pandas look very lazy and happy.","10694":"Red pandas were awesome too.","10695":"Would recommend.","10696":"Its all uphill so you can feel tired by the end of the day.","10697":"Smaller than Chester zoo and landscape not as user friendly.","10698":"We arrived at the zoo early and as there were no details of opening times on any of the literature it was too early and we had to wait outside for half an hour.","10699":"Not the best of starts - and we weren't the only ones.","10700":"But the zoo itself was lovely.","10701":"It is quite small but spread over the hillside the animals have plenty of room in their enclosures.","10702":"Of course we had to see the giant pandas and he was lovely but we do question the time, effort and money put into their support when we come from Suffolk where the Suffolk Punch is even more endangered than the panda and where they could benefit so much from the kind of support the pandas get.","10703":"The Suffolk Punches are the real gentle giants.","10704":"But the star of the show were the Red Pandas.","10705":"Quite adorable!","10706":"The kids absolutely had a ball, so much to do with great animals.","10707":"All very well kept and the souvenir shop was great, highly recommended.","10708":"But wish more animals would oblige and put in an appearance.","10709":"Perhaps abetter place to visit in summer.","10710":"Still, grandson enjoyed the visit.","10711":"Disappointed at the amount of empty enclosures and a lot of the occupied ones were grim and bare.","10712":"There\u2019s a new Panda area being built which looks impressive and I hope they move on to improving other areas when this is completed.","10713":"A little more investment will go a long way to attracting more visitors.","10714":"The staff were incredibly friendly and helpful.","10715":"I also met one of the keepers whilst he displayed the interactive reptile session.","10716":"You could truly see how much love and passion he had for those creatures so it was awesome to see the animals being treated so well.","10717":"They also have rescues in the zoo which is really fear to know they are not just taking animals from their homes but actually being saved by cruel situations.","10718":"There\u2019s plenty of activities for kids to do and two lovely cafes as well as lots of outdoor seating areas.","10719":"Had a great time!","10720":"This is probably the best zoo I've ever been to.","10721":"My daughter loved seeing all the animals and you can get pretty close to them.","10722":"The staff who go around and give talks about the different animals make it an even better experience.","10723":"Make sure not to miss the penguin parade!","10724":"Only getting 4 stars cos could see some of the animals but it was a very hot day so they were probably hiding in the shade.","10725":"It was always our dream to see the penguins parade one day.","10726":"Even better after we git the chance to do the keeper experience for the penguins.","10727":"Excellent zoo, great collection, and a Mecca fir the penguin enthusiasts.","10728":"Brilliant zoo! Seems small and a bit of a trek uphill but actually took me and my partner a good 6 hours of exploring and eating our way around.","10729":"Loads of variety of animals and such good viewing opportunities, all animals suitably enriched and had plenty of space and lots of talks, I'd recommend going on a week day and booking online to save yourself a few quid and queuing","10730":"We booked our entrance tickets online, there is a discount for online bookings by the way.","10731":"We travelled to Edinburgh Zoo on a bus, from Princes Street.","10732":"It was only a couple of pounds for our bus tickets, and the journey only took 15 minutes or so.","10733":"Edinburgh Zoo is a Charity.","10734":"All of the money that they make is ploughed into caring for their resident animals and into conservation work world wide.","10735":"They highlight the importance of helping not just the larger, famous endangered species, but the small and often overlooked creatures that are nevertheless an important part of the ecosystem of our world.","10736":"Edinburgh Zoo is part of the Royal Zoological Society of Scotland and it shows.","10737":"The Zoo is tidy, clean and well organised.","10738":"The animals are all obviously very healthy, well cared for, and happy.","10739":"The staff are all helpful, friendly, and extremely knowledgeable and passionate about the animals in their care.","10740":"We spent nearly 4 hours in Edinburgh Zoo, and will definitely be going there again.","10741":"We were so very impressed by what we saw, that we voted for Edinburgh Zoo in the Scottish Charity Awards, and we sincerely hope that they win.","10742":"I personally wish that we lived in Edinburgh, as I would dearly love to join the excellent, if not exceptional team, at Edinburgh Zoo.","10743":"This is a very beautiful zoo.","10744":"Great location near the centre of Edinburgh with beautiful views everywhere.","10745":"The Panda bears are there of course and this alone makes it worth s visit.","10746":"Also it is great to see the Lorikeets especially when you have children.","10747":"You can feed them and they will sit on your arm or shoulder.","10748":"Beautiful colourful birds they are.","10749":"The animals are very well looked after and have beautiful enclosures.","10750":"Plenty of places to have some food as well.","10751":"Well worth a visit","10752":"Has a great day at the zoo very easy to get there by bus from the city center.","10753":"But do take in to consideration when going the zoo is build on the side of quite a steep hill so can be hard going.","10754":"This is our second visit to Edinburgh zoo and must say it\u2019s a great day out (especially on a nice day which we had) you can save a couple of quid buying tickets online , had a great time watching the monkeys play fighting and the youngsters tumbling about it was a very hot day so a few were asleep in the hot temperatures (if only we had that sense lol)","10755":"We weren't sure what to expect at the zoo , but it was a most enjoyable day for the family including the adults & our granddaughter certainly loved the various animals & of course the playgrounds around the whole complex.","10756":"Even though their are steep pathways around zoo complex, if you take you time you can enjoy the walks, in a lot of shaded areas with lovely trees.","10757":"We spent around 5 1\/2 hrs in the zoo and saw most of the animals, birds, penguins - which were wonderful to watch at feeding time.","10758":"Monkeys - numerous breeds, Pandas etc.Had lunch at the Penguin Cafe which was nice & food was tasty with costs reasonable as well.","10759":"Commentary by staff at several locations was very helpful and interesting to listen too.","10760":"Plenty of amenities throughout the zoo area.","10761":"Aussie Tourist.","10762":"I went to the zoo on Easter Sunday with a couple of friends.","10763":"I was visiting my friend in Edinburgh and have always wanted to go to this zoo so was very excited!!The zoo itself was lovely, although not a patch on Chester or Blackpool!","10764":"They don't have elephants or giraffes which are my two favourite animals \ud83d\ude22 they did however have pandas and koalas although they were both sleeping.","10765":"It was maybe because it was a hot day but almost all the animals were sleeping so didn't get to see much!","10766":"The penguins were my fave on the day but again they didn't want to do the parade so thought it was a bit of a wasted trip \ud83d\ude12","10767":"Phew.","10768":"Built on a steep hill.","10769":"A guide gave a super talk starting at the bottom but moved up the hill to the next so fast his audience wilted one by one.","10770":"Never a good idea to go to a zoo on a hot day.","10771":"Anything with any sense is inside and asleep which can make for a disappointing visit","10772":"We love going to zoos and Edinburgh Zoo does have its fair share of animals to look at along with loads of fascinating talks about many different animals across the day.","10773":"It is located on a very steep hill which could make it difficult for older people or those in wheelchairs but it is definitely a fun day and you could easily spend multiple hours at the place.","10774":"My only criticism comes from the prices of food and drinks within the zoo itself.","10775":"It\u2019s a bit of a captive audience and the prices are ridiculous for the amount you receive.","10776":"I would definitely recommend bringing your own food and drink to avoid having to pay the prices that they charge.","10777":"You do have to pay for parking but it is in Edinburgh so you sort of expect that.","10778":"Good bus services also run along the route and stop more or less at the entrance so it\u2019s easy to get to.","10779":"Really surprised how large the zoo was .","10780":"Impressed on how much space each resident was afforded.","10781":"Clean and an abundance of toilet facilities.","10782":"Would definitely go again.","10783":"This was the first time we had visited the zoo.","10784":"It was a great day out enjoyed by all including the teenagers of 14 and 15 years.","10785":"The only thing I would say is to look for the  que in the road as it was for the zoo","10786":"but we didn\u2019t realise so we passed it and had to turn around .Definitely","10787":"worth a visit .","10788":"The zoo is on the hill so bear this in mind when planning the visit.","10789":"It covers a large area so comfortable shoes are a must.","10790":"The animals are great and how they are presented is different from any other zoo I\u2019ve been to.","10791":"You can eat there as they have couple restaurants onsite however we didn\u2019t try them so don\u2019t know the quality.","10792":"If you visit in the warm months they will have an ice cream spot open-","10793":"they are delicious and fresh.","10794":"The best part of the zoo are defo penguins \ud83d\udc27 and the monkeys \ud83d\ude01Totally recommend but make sure you have enough time - at least 2-3 hours just to see the animals without any stops.","10795":"This is not a very good zoo.","10796":"It has loads of space without animals.","10797":"It has little parks for children.","10798":"The animals were good.","10799":"Really expensive though.","10800":"What an amazing Zoo!!","10801":"Me and my husband visited the zoo and new from past experience that it is on a steep hill.","10802":"I recently had a spinal operation and 7 months pregnant and knew I wouldn't managed the walk so I brought with me a disabled scooter  on arrival they greeted us with very helpful information a guide for best route for a wheelchair and a number you could call for them to take you to spots around the zoo!","10803":"We had taken advantage of this and asked to be take.","10804":"To the top so all I had to do is a trail down hill in the scooter and what a difference this had made I was truly happy being able to see all the beautiful animals and to be treated with kindness and such helpful staff!!","10805":"Though the weather wasn't at its best all the animals was still out Even the Pandas which was amazing to see.","10806":"The enclosures are fantastic too to say it was a zoo and was over all just amazing!","10807":"X","10808":"Really enjoyed going all around the zoo to visit all the animals.","10809":"Enjoyed as well the walk through where you can walk just beside some species of animals.","10810":"Nice gift shop.","10811":"Second time in the zoo and love it every time!","10812":"Was lovely seeing the panda, you need good walking legs also good for wheel chair users!","10813":"\ud83d\ude42","10814":"I feel sorry for the animals at the zoo - there are so many SCREAMING children everywhere.","10815":"Can the parents not tell them to stop, not set a bad example by banging on glass, etc.?","10816":"It's insane that they're allowed to constantly behave in this way over and over again.","10817":"The bears were clearly hiding every time a kid was near, the lorikeets were screeching because children were climbing all over parts of the enclosure they weren't meant to be in, and families were making a huge noise in a koala enclosure that is meant to be near enough silent.","10818":"Not the fault of the zoo but man alive, make it stop.","10819":"It's animal cruelty.","10820":"Food is massively overpriced but the staff in the Grasslands restaurant were really friendly so good for them.","10821":"Same can't be said for the miserable people in the Penguin Cafe...","10822":"Also, it's really hard to walk up the hill","10823":"but I have no idea where to ask for help getting a lift in the cars they have as I am not visibly disabled.","10824":"There's loads to see in the zoo but it's very well spread out and you need to be fit to make it to the top of the hill where the tiger lives.","10825":"Well worth the effort though as the views are excellent too.","10826":"The kids love it and there are lots of places to have a picnic.","10827":"Picnics are recommended as the prices in the outlets are not cheap.","10828":"Entry prices too are quite expensive.","10829":"Not a place for a cold wet day but fun when the sun is shining.","10830":"The staff were outstanding at the zoo and definitely added to the day.","10831":"We had a great time exploring and found it so well set up to see most of the animals.","10832":"The penguins didn\u2019t want to come out but we were lucky enough to see the koalas and one of the pandas.","10833":"Food at the Jungle Food Court was good, fresh and very quickly prepared.","10834":"Beautifully laid out zoo with a vast variety of animals from all over the world with interesting talks from the keepers including feeding time and penguin parades!","10835":"Best zoo in the uk?","10836":"Cannot remember last time we went to a zoo.","10837":"This is in a lovely setting with lovely planting so you meander nicely through.","10838":"It is hilly so a good climb if you want to see everythingHighlight was the pandas which was main reason for visiting but there was so much more to see which was fascinating!Great day out","10839":"literally the most miserable displays i have ever seen.whole place is tired and depressing.half the animals do not appear to be there.food is overpriced and literally substandard.","10840":"do not ,mind getting overcharged a bit for food but when its rubbish.it actually becomes a total piss take and reflects so badly on the place and the apathy  they must have for the general public.fact i wonder if they got the human food mixed up with the animal feed.cant actually find anything that good to say about the place.just totally underwhelming and just not worth the entrance fee","10841":"We are regular visitors to the zoo after grandparents bought little one an annual pass.","10842":"Love it every visit.","10843":"New playground facilities are great.","10844":"Dad did a morning as a keeper which he loved.","10845":"But definitely take you own food, the cafe offering is awful.","10846":"A small bowl of thin, salty inedible soup for \u00a35, the worst coffee in Edinburgh and no allergen information available (I was even told we should \u201cgo to the restaurant\u201d if we wanted to know what was in the food.)","10847":"We have been too lots zoo as We love animals,we like to  see how well they are look after , all we can say is yes the best place for all animals are in their own habits, and if not make it the next best thing, Edinburgh Zoo you have one of best we have been to and we will love to go back , keep up the great work ,","10848":"Arrived at half 10, stayed until 4 and still didn't see everything we wanted to.","10849":"The very definition of value for money.","10850":"Paid just under \u00a340 for a full day out (brought our own lunches etc).","10851":"Enjoyed a trip to the zoo, particularly enjoyed the penguin parade and Scottish Wildcats.","10852":"Would have been nice to see some of the more elusive animals such as the otters which are normally a favourite of mine but they seemed to be in hiding although this was through no fault of the zoos.","10853":"The zoo was quite hilly but the views from the top were well worth the climb.","10854":"Loved my visit to the zoo.","10855":"My family are Dublin Zoo members and have a family pass which enabled me to get in for free with them.","10856":"So much to see and its beautifully spread out.","10857":"Its mostly all uphill so this could be a challenge for some people!","10858":"The highlight was seeing the pandas and the penguins.","10859":"Fabulous day out but bring your own food as the onsite facilities are very expensive.","10860":"Seeing the pandas at Edinburgh zoo was what made us book a week away and it was well worth it!","10861":"Lovely grounds and enclosures with lots of picnic and play areas to keep little ones entertained.","10862":"Lots of amazing animals to see and lots of work going on by staff.","10863":"There is a new panda enclosures that looks as though it will be amazing!","10864":"A lovely day out and will return when we are next there!","10865":"Put comfy shoes on as lots of walking and hills!","10866":"A work out for my husband pushing our toddler in the pram!!","10867":"They did offer assistance for those with mobility issues I noticed.","10868":"Node gift shop at the end and places to get a coffee, food and ice lollies!","10869":"My favourite zoo.","10870":"Animals are all looked after well","10871":"and I was lucky enough to see the penguins come out for a walk.","10872":"The pandas were just gorgeous and it was a fab day out enjoyed by all.","10873":"I enjoy going to the zoo very much and this did not disappoint.","10874":"Not far from the city centre by bus\/easy to get to.","10875":"Lots of animals to see but very hilly in places.","10876":"Food can be expensive so would advise bringing your own if you can.","10877":"We arrived here around 11.40am..bit of a queue but ok... gift aid is a bit cheeky as all ready added on!!The zoo is up a hill and not ideal for those with mobility issues..even I struggled a bit in partsGood range of animals ...but limited and unlike Chester no giraffes or elephants ?","10878":"Ate in the penguin cafe \u00a316 for 2 sandwiches , bottle of pop a small Danish and a cookie ..not badA few eateries closed ... like rhe barbecue&salad place which we had headed for !","10879":"Penguin parade only 5 out but good.","10880":"Dropped a star as just after 3 we went to go into the lemur enclosure walk through and a keeper was coming out saying sorry guys just closing this you can see through the fence ...really we couldn't !","10881":"Went back half hour later still closedGutted as came a long way and weren't advised this at the gate !","10882":"Popped in shop lois on till was very helpful getting our worktop saver and chatting as she did so","10883":"A really lovely day out with the wife.","10884":"I've never seen a panda before so that was awesome.","10885":"Other highlights were getting so close to the rhinos and the penguin area.","10886":"We have visited a number of zoos in 4 countries but this was excellent , intimate.","10887":"And gets you up close.","10888":"The koalas, the pandas, meerkats and penguins were special.","10889":"Well worth a visit and a good 4 hours needed.","10890":"Ak","10891":"One of our highlights absolutely loved our day here.","10892":"Staff friendly and loved all the animals especially the tiger","10893":"You need a full day here to make the most of your visit.","10894":"The zoo is on and big hill","10895":"so you get some wonderful views.","10896":"The place is clean and you can see they keep maintaining the areas.","10897":"All the staff great , helpful and informative.","10898":"I would recommend that you take a packed lunch.","10899":"Lots of areas to sit.","10900":"I feel the place would benefit from a nice tea room.","10901":"To save money book on line, you can do this up to midnight the day before.","10902":"We enjoyed our visit.","10903":"This was the best zoo we have ever visited.","10904":"Beautiful setting and lots of different animals.","10905":"The highlight being the giant pandas.","10906":"We spent over 5 hours there and could have spent alot more.","10907":"Food was good and there is a great shop on the grounds.","10908":"My boy age 7 and girl age 10 loved the day.","10909":"They were looking forward to seing the pandas in reality after watching them on live panda cams for about a year.","10910":"My wife and i also had a great day.","10911":"An amazing zoo and lovely to see so much development work going on to give the animals more room in their enclosures.","10912":"We visited Edinburgh purely for a trip to the zoo and to see the giant pandas.","10913":"A great attraction which you can easily access via a local bus.","10914":"Ok firstly I must say that I had some corporate free tickets that my wife received from her work so we only had to pay for one adultNow the most important thing, when in the enormous line waiting to pay at the till point I overheard people talking about an automatic donation?We were asked at till point would we like to make a donation, we refused as the cost is obscene for what Edinburgh Zoo has to offer.","10915":"Then I noticed that the donation was taken off the gate price so entry was reduced to \u00a318.10 from \u00a319.99As for the zoo, erm.","10916":"Where are the animals???","10917":"Ok it was a hot day","10918":"and yes I\u2019m sure they were all sheltered from the sun but it leaves you a little short changedOne thing to remember to bring is a rubbish bag, there seems to be a shortage of rubbish bins.","10919":"As if they are thinking of charging the ones you find.","10920":"It was a busy day and hardly if any of the food kiosks were open, eh?","10921":"If they want to make money have food kiosk openI suppose they want you to use the obscene over priced cafe \u2014note that there is a water dispenser in the cafe with tap water which is freeThere is a house there that can be hired for weddings which is ok, but god help anyone who wanders into the gate.","10922":"We walked into a side gate and sat down for around 15mins then suddenly we were told to get out as we are not allowed in the area, we were told that there are signs eh don\u2019t think so, not on the side gate where we went in.","10923":"It\u2019s amazing they never fired elephant guns at us !","10924":"All n all it\u2019s a place I would never choose to go to only due to cost and after this visit I just confirmed my thoughts, I wouldn\u2019t go backOne last thing, why do people line up to park in the zoo parking costing \u00a34 when the street parking outside is free on a Saturday all along the bus lane ????","10925":"A lovely zoo, lots to see and do, staff are very interactive and very informative, penguin parade was lovely.","10926":"We had a great day at the zoo.","10927":"Loved the Pandas, although we didn't see Sunshine, he stayed in his bed, and Sweetie was fast asleep the whole time too, but at least we could see her!","10928":"The Sun Bears are great and so are the Koala's, not something you see at most Zoos.","10929":"Loved the Tiger viewing, especially when he walked right above us on the glass roof.","10930":"We have only been to Edingburgh twice, and both times it was to visit this Zoo.","10931":"First thing to note is that the zoo is on a hill and you will get some exercise around the large site.","10932":"This was our second visit and I have to say I didn't feel the same magic as before.","10933":"That being said I would recommend you go if you like to see the animals and haven't been before.","10934":"With Pandas, Red Pandas, Lions, Rhinos, Pygmy Hippos, Sun Bears and Koalas, there are some interesting animals.","10935":"The Penguin enclosure is fantastic with plenty of space and there is work in progress for a new Panda enclosure.","10936":"We found the food options fairly limited so would recommend taking a picnic.","10937":"We all had a great day out as part of an extended trip to Edinburgh.","10938":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo at 12 noon and our visit lasted 4 hours with an abundance of animals to see.","10939":"Tip - buy your tickets online by midnight the night before to safe 10% and like us if you have a ScotRail Child's Ticket your child gets in free.","10940":"There were no queues even on the Wed of Easter Week.","10941":"The highlights of our visit was the Penguin Parade which happens at 2.15 pm each day.","10942":"The Penguins are let out of their enclosure for a Parade around the area.","10943":"Another highlight for my daughter was feeding the Red River Hogs with vegetables.","10944":"At Edinburgh Zoo there are not designated feeding times for the animals as in the past the animals were waiting to be fed at those times.","10945":"The Zoo is on a hill but we walked up the left side","10946":"and it was fine.","10947":"We saw loads of animals including Pandas, Koalas, Lions, Monkeys, Flamingoes and our daughter could have watched the baboons play all day.","10948":"Tip - bring a picnic and plan it around 1 pm, 1.30 pm and have it beside the Penguins so you are close by for the Penguin Parade at 2.15 pm beside the Play Park.","10949":"Great picnic tables and what I was impressed with was an outside sink area with soap to wash hands before eating.","10950":"There is a shop and if your child wants a souvenir the writing pencils are only 50p in variety of bright colours.","10951":"Also there is a car park charge of \u00a34.","10952":"Also if the animals are not outside check their enclosures.","10953":"All in all a great visit.","10954":"First time we\u2019ve been to the zoo for quite a while and, to be honest, we were disappointed.","10955":"There were a lack of big animals and in general most were either hard to see or sleeping.","10956":"For what you pay this is disappointing.","10957":"Been to better zoos for less cost.","10958":"Visited today and had a wonderful day!","10959":"Pre booked to get best price on tickets.","10960":"Lucky to see lots of animals out to see.","10961":"Nice gardens and play areas, places to have a picnic.","10962":"Glad we took a picnic as food expensive in cafe.","10963":"If staying in Edinburgh would certainly recommend a visit.","10964":"Bank Holiday Easter Monday, visited the zoo with our 3 year old granddaughter.","10965":"Didn\u2019t buy tickets in advance however the queue moved quickly (10 mins).","10966":"There were a lot of enclosures with nothing in them.","10967":"Even the animals sleeping quarters were empty??","10968":"Best part of the afternoon was the penguin march that lasts about 20 seconds as they pass around the path.","10969":"The zoo could do with water drinking fountains to refill drinking bottles but guess they wouldn\u2019t be able to sell water then at their exorbitant prices.","10970":"Note that the zoo is on a fairly steep hill in some parts.","10971":"Glad that we went, but it\u2019s a tick in the box - done","10972":"Great afternoon spent here , as members of Chester Zoo our membership entitles us to use Edinburgh Zoo for free too ....","10973":"Tip use the members entrance by the top of the zoo in the corner of the carpark, saved us a lot of time Queuing !","10974":"Went in the summer holidays and there was quite a Q for the carpark ( although plenty or spaces when we finally got in) , if you can get the bus in or alternative transport then I would suggest it , due to the steep entrance and Q's your clutch will thank you for it.","10975":"Because of the location of the Zoo ie built into a steep rocky hill , the enclosures tend to blend in a lot more than other Zoo's , and the animals seem more at home ....","10976":"however this comes at a price and people with limited mobility may suffer with some of the inclines .The walk through areas are great , and the animal enclosures put you closer to the animals than some Zoo , really enjoyed the day , especially seeing the Pandas","10977":"Visited on Easter Sunday 2019 4 adults and 2 children, we booked on line and i didn't think the price was bad for a full days trip out, We were not phased by the zoo being on a hill its all exercise if your capable so wear comfy shoes, The weather was lovely which helped.","10978":"The biggest issue i have is the lack of animals, As we were walking round there were little huts that i presume would normally sell drinks and snacks but they were all closed so once your at the top of the zoo make sure you have taken a drink and a snack with you.","10979":"Take a packed lunch as drinks and food-snacks are expensive.","10980":"I noticed they had a ride on vehicle that went around the zoo however this was not in service which was disappointing, i can only assume the lack of staff was due to it being Easter.","10981":"I wouldn't go again and i wouldn't recommend it","10982":"Great value zoo.","10983":"Book online to save money.","10984":"Kids free with Blue Peter badges \/ cards.","10985":"Pandas were a real highlight.","10986":"We got so close and it wasn't too busy despite it being a bank holiday.","10987":"Wished we brought a picnic as food choice awful.","10988":"Drinks and ice creams v expensive too.","10989":"Built on a hill so not great with small children or the elderly   kids loved the gift shop and bus stops right outside.","10990":"We spent the whole day there, the places to eat were clean and tidy, something for all budgets.","10991":"Good selection in the gift shop and for a family of five it was good value for admission.","10992":"You need comfy shoes as there\u2019s so much to see, once you reach the top of the zoo the views are amazing.","10993":"The displays the zoo keepers do are very informative and the kids loved the penguin walk.","10994":"There are plenty of places to sit and rest as you go round.","10995":"Don't really understand some of the poor reviews for this Zoo.","10996":"It's a good zoo, well laid out, plenty of facilities and the animals are clearly cared for and looked after well.","10997":"Highlights include seeing the Giant Pandas.","10998":"We went early and one was asleep so we went back later in the afternoon they were both up and one was outside.","10999":"It doesn't get too busy to see them.","11000":"The Tiger talk was worth listening to and a special mention for the Penguin Parade where they let some of the Penguins walk out around the visitors which was a nice novelty.","11001":"Would recommend getting there early and wear some good walking shoes as there are a few hills and changeable terrain.","11002":"We were very much looking forward to seeing the Zoo and it\u2019s inhabitants.","11003":"The zoo itself is easy to go to from the city centre with just a short bus journey.","11004":"The zoo itself is moderately priced considering it is a city zoo.","11005":"We entered and we impressed by the size of the zoo\u2019s grounds but were not to know it has hills everywhere","11006":"and I mean everywhere!The zoo seems to have been built on a hillside as it is barely flat and depending what animals you like (eg: Tigers, Lions, Rhinos, Zebras) you have to climb to the very top of the hills.","11007":"It was a nice day","11008":"so it was not too much of an issue but for people who struggle to walk or find hills difficult I would consider visiting as it can be very tiring.","11009":"There are benches around the zoo but visitor to bench ratio is not enough.","11010":"You are rewarded with great views of Edinburgh when you reach the top of the hills.","11011":"The animals themselves are great and a lot to see.","11012":"We mainly wanted to see the tigers, koalas and pandas but the koalas and pandas were out of view and sleeping so if you go specifically to see them; like at all zoos; be prepared you may have to wait to see them (if at all).A highlight of the day was the penguin parade where staff walk with some of the penguins at certain times of the day.","11013":"It\u2019s really cute and great to have witnessed.","11014":"There are not many places for food and drink so best to bring your own and what they have available is expensive so again I\u2019d advise to bring your own lunch\/picnics.","11015":"If you absolutely love animals, don\u2019t mind hills and bring your own lunch then you will more likely than not have a great day.","11016":"We wish we knew about the layout of the zoo beforehand so hindsight would have been valuable at the time.","11017":"Don\u2019t be put off going though.","11018":"It is a nice zoo","11019":"and I hope you enjoy if you decide to visit.","11020":"All the hype for Edinburgh zoo I thought its worth a visit with the family & we thought it was very poor.","11021":"The whole layout of the zoo is on an incline & up hill!!!","11022":"You will find it extremely difficult to push prams up etc.. Most of the animals were also hidden because of the over grown areas inside where they stay & I think the zoo needs a huge upgrade!Our main highlight were the penguins but that\u2019s because we could see them.","11023":"There\u2019s some excellent zoos out there & flat & also areas where you can see the animals, I don\u2019t understand how people can say \u201cdon\u2019t listen to the bad reviews\u201d LOOK at the bad reviews before you purchase tickets( when entering car park your always on an incline in a queue lol try not burning your clutch out!!!)","11024":"My husband and i visited Easter bank holiday weekend -","11025":"yes it was very busy and really warm but extremely enjoyable.","11026":"We saw almost all animals, some were asleep but that is natural...","11027":"It is all based on a hill but when we entered they asked about mobility and we saw many people utilising the car transport to the top (for mobility issues).","11028":"The speaker of the day was called Tom and he was hilarious, we had Lord of the Rings and walking dead references and some jokes thrown in.","11029":"He was very informative and made the talks fun.","11030":"We saw the panda inside twice which was not too busy (unfortunately couldn't find the second panda - which wasn't the zoos fault).","11031":"All in all it was a really great day and we will be returning!","11032":"We took our 11mo daughter to the zoo today and were lucky enough to get the glorious weather!","11033":"I was a little apprehensive as I'd read some of the previous reviews but as it happened we saw almost every animal that we went to see!","11034":"The pandas unfortunately didn't make an appearance and we avoided the queue and skipped the koalas, but other than that we were very pleased with the amount of animals that we saw.","11035":"I would recommend the zoo but believe me when I say that comfy shoes are a must - it's on a hill and you'll spend a lot of time on your feet.","11036":"It isn't the cheapest day out","11037":"but you could easily spend the whole day there so you can get your money's worth.","11038":"Also book online for the discounted prices.","11039":"This is one of Edinburghs best attractions.","11040":"Yes it is up a hill ( it always has been ).","11041":"Yes its pricey but its by no means pricier than a lot of lesser attractions all over the Uk.","11042":"Plus they offer Membership which is definately worth it.","11043":"Some of the comments about not seeing the animals..... Have a word.","11044":"You cant go prodding and poking animals to sing and dance for us on demand.","11045":"Trust me if they did youd be the ones complaining about animal cruelty.","11046":"Bottom line.","11047":"The Zoo is class.","11048":"Very well maintained and reasonable value.","11049":"Had a fabulous time at the zoo.","11050":"We mainly went to see the Giant pandas.","11051":"We were not disappointed.","11052":"Lots of different species of animals to see.","11053":"Friendly and helpful staff.","11054":"Be prepared to walk alot.","11055":"Terrible most animals were hidden or asleep panda what we wanted to see stayed in doors saw him from a distance in cave entrance ,must be terrible for family\u2019s ( mama don\u2019t take me to zoo tomorrow \ud83c\udfbc\ud83c\udfbc) very over priced shabby catering ie bottle water 2.25 come on ice clippo 2.00 not nice for family\u2019s should hand over to a caterer .The place as a whole needs sorting no management could run this worse","11056":"Only zoo in the UK with Giant Pandas.","11057":"Lots of Koalas and King penguins too, which are not often seen.","11058":"Be prepared for hill walks.","11059":"Would be a 5* rating but severely lacking in reptiles.","11060":"Easy to get to from Airport\/City, bus stops right outside, about 20 mins from Waverley Bridge.","11061":"When we travel I like to visit zoos.","11062":"We stood in line a long time to get in and it was up a hill.","11063":"Many animals weren't visible.","11064":"The few we saw were sleeping or non-active.","11065":"We saw mice in the enclosure ( I believe it was the Panda that just had a baby).","11066":"The children watching were all commenting.","11067":"Lots of hills so not easy for anyone with a wheelchair or walking difficulties.","11068":"Price was high for what we saw.","11069":"The shop inside for souvenirs was disappointing.","11070":"They only had one type of refrigerator magnet, no good cup selection and no t-shirts.","11071":"Most of the animals were out of sight or in the back of the enclosure.","11072":"The panda was asleep on his back.","11073":"The penguins and Pygmy hippopotamus were worth the trip.","11074":"Many hills but a well laid out trail around the exhibits.","11075":"The meerkats were interesting.","11076":"As a resident of Edinburgh i go several times a year only because my special needs brother has a pass which allows us to go anytime for 65 pounds for the year.","11077":"I would never ever pay full price.dont know if I'm just jaded as I've been so many times bit quiet often I comment that a lot of the enclosures you can't see much.","11078":"For example the last time we went the majority of the enclosures in the monkey house were empty.","11079":"Definately worth going to see a glimpse of the pandas they really are amazing and the penguin enclosure is fab.","11080":"However compared to other zoos I've been to such a Blackpool","11081":"I'm just not that impressed.","11082":"For my my hunnt and toddler it would be over 50 pounds and then a further 4 pounds to park","11083":"First visit here and loved every minute.","11084":"Animals looked healthy and happy.","11085":"Staff were friendly and very informative.","11086":"Full day out and well woth the money.","11087":"Highly recommended","11088":"Set into a hillside Edinburgh Zoo has great views, a large range of animals to view and more information on the conservation effort throughout the world.","11089":"The map you receive on arrival of the site is clear and well laid out.","11090":"My one piece of advice would be to go to the highest point of the zoo to the view point and then work your way down the hills.","11091":"Places to eat on site cover all budgets including places to picnic and clean toilets are all over the place.","11092":"This was a 21st birthday treat for my daughter who does all things zoo, ecology wise and this had thumbs up from her","11093":"The highlight of the visit has to be seeing the Giant Pandas.","11094":"We were very lucky as both of them were out and wandering around their enclosures.","11095":"The site is steep in places but there are plenty of benches to have a sit down and rest when little legs get tired.","11096":"We saw all of the animals and we spent around 6 hours looking around.","11097":"The only minus point was the food, we are in the jungle cafe, we paid \u00a340 for 3 cheeseburgers, a hot dog, 4 portions of chips and 4 cold drinks.","11098":"It was cold and tasteless and we all left most of it, it made McDonald's look like a gourmet meal!","11099":"I could recall visiting Edinburgh Zoo many years ago as a child and must admit there is not such a large range of bigger animals now.","11100":"No elephants or giraffes.","11101":"The panda and penguins were our highlight.","11102":"The penguin area is large with a very big pool and underwater viewing area.","11103":"A new area is under development for the pandas.","11104":"Worth a visit.","11105":"Queued for 40 'min to get in and was disappointing due to there being alot of upkeep needing....","11106":"Maintenance by fences being painted, walkways uneven, walkways need brushing up of dust, not enough areas to sit when you are using walking stick etc.","11107":"Not as many animals and more expensive than Chester Zoo which has to be the best zoo ever.","11108":"Ice cream huts shut too when walking around.","11109":"Wouldn't recommend for people unsteady on feet or in wheel chairs as alot of areas have steps and uneven broken paths.","11110":"My wife, 2 kids and I went.","11111":"Pre-paid and the line was huge....","11112":"so you're stood outside for a while and it was freezing.","11113":"Only good point to pre-paying is it's a little cheaper but i would've paid the extra bit especially when you have a 4 and 3 year old with you outside in the cold.","11114":"The zoo itself - very disappointing.","11115":"Apart from the usual, penguins and some birds, i think we saw one Lion who was sat in one place - difficult to see due to the trees etc.  Most of the animals were asleep.","11116":"They have the penguin parade","11117":"but we didn't last that long - most of the walk is up hill","11118":"so you're shattered withing an hour or two.","11119":"Kids were bored within half an hour as every bit we got to, there was no animal to be seen.","11120":"Best bit was the panda but again, he was asleep.","11121":"When it came to feeding time he came out","11122":"but then it was packed","11123":"and you could hardly see anything.","11124":"Food areas - mayhem.","11125":"One restaurant had staff that were helpful but no tables.","11126":"Other restaurant - no staff to help but a few tables but again lines were huge.","11127":"Would definitely not go again and I wouldn't really recommend it either.","11128":"If you're a couple and looking for something to do, its a nice walk round the whole area.","11129":"Beautiful view from the hilltop.","11130":"If you're trying to entertain kids, a waste of money.","11131":"Was very disappointed with zoo!,, not an awful lot of animals very poor!","11132":"Very hilly and did not see any staff on walk about!if anything should have happened there was no one about to get help!!Belfast zoo is a lot better !","11133":"And very expensive","11134":"Very good day out for whole family!","11135":"Edinburgh Zoo is one of the best zoos we have been to.","11136":"Clenliness, animal welfare are excellent.","11137":"Pre book to avoid longer queue but that said,  the non pre book queue went down very fast so was not a problem.","11138":"I highly recommend going to the Edinburgh zoo if you go to Edinburgh and make sure not to miss the zookeeper talks.","11139":"They are very informative and the main organizer will take you all over the zoo after starting at the meerkat exhibit at the front of the zoo.","11140":"I cannot really comment on the food because I packed my lunch, and I would recommend that you do so as there are some picnic tables and a nice grassy area right by penguin rock in which to eat lunch.","11141":"The tiger enclosure was particularly interesting because we were in a tunnel while the zookeeper was giving his talk and the tiger actually walked over us, which was a bit surreal.","11142":"I also liked that the zoo was promoting a message of sustainability and advertised that people need to buy products that use sustainable palm oil in order to protect endangered species who are threatened by the loss of habitat from the use of unsustainable palm oil.","11143":"For instance, during one of the talks, the zookeeper mentioned how forests in Indonesia have been burned down to make way for growing palm oil and that cannot continue if species like the Sumatran tiger are able to exist in the wild.","11144":"I also feel like I learned more about the importance of birds to our ecosystems and the fact that humans need to protect them if we want to live on this planet.","11145":"Anyway, the three minor negative things that I encountered was that the zoo is built on a very steep hill, so be prepared (other reviewers have mentioned this), there are not that many toilets, and the pandas did not seem to be out in their exhibit.","11146":"Overall, the zoo is definitely worth going to, and I spent around 4 hours there.","11147":"My girlfriend and I are in our early 20s and we wondered if going to a zoo was a little young for us, having been I now think that I will be going to any zoo that I have the chance too.","11148":"The day we went was overcast and had intermittent showers, but this didn't put a dampener on our day.","11149":"We were first greeted by meerkats, my girlfriend melted immediately which made it difficult to get her to move on.","11150":"From there we spent time wandering trying to make our way to the different animals before their particular sections closed (some of the animal's areas close early).The animals most of note were: the mother and baby koala, the rhinos, penguins, pandas and all the birds.","11151":"I won't go into detail about each one but if your hobby is photography, which mine is, then this place is a must.","11152":"Overall this was a great experience.","11153":"We spent the whole afternoon at the zoo and we could have been there longer.","11154":"I would highly recommend anyone go there, especially if you have kids as there are a lot of activities just for them as well as the animals.","11155":"We had high hopes for Edinburgh Zoo, but we were very disappointed.","11156":"I wouldn't advise anyone to visit this place.","11157":"One of the first things that we noticed was the small , depressing enclosures which did not look fit for animals to be living in.","11158":"There was a major lack of animals , a lot of the enclosures\/ indoor areas were empty!The layout of the zoo is mainly uphill so be prepared!There are some over-priced cafes- the one we went to was dirty and some of the staff were very rude.","11159":"Better to bring your own snacks etc.","11160":"We paid \u00a339 for entry for 2 adults which is very expensive considering the lack of animals!","11161":"Nice zoo with great facilities for both the animals and the paying visitors.","11162":"Expensive day out but worthwhile.","11163":"On a rare sunny day in April we took the bus to the zoo.","11164":"It\u2019s a steep hillside location and whilst a car will take people around the site there are no mobility scooters for hire, so this place may not suit all needs.","11165":"We did get a free carers ticket.","11166":"There is a schedule of talks through the day, each provided by staff experts .","11167":"There is SO much to see here including pandas, Sumatran Tigers, Pygmy hippo, lions, mandrills, penguins sun bears, meerkat and lemurs.","11168":"The on-site cafes are reasonably priced and there is so much to see that you could really do two days here to see it all properly.","11169":"The welfare of the animals is the clear priority here, and there is lots of information about endangered species too, with information about the zoo programmes they\u2019re engaged in internationally.","11170":"Very family friendly.","11171":"We absolutely loved it.","11172":"Well worth a visit","11173":"We (my husband, myself and three daughters) looked forward to visiting Edinburgh zoo as part of our week visiting the capital for the first time.","11174":"Not knowing much about the zoo, only that it is home to a giant panda, we had high hopes and assumed the zoo was around the size of Chester zoo (near our home), this was not the case.","11175":"Animal enclosuresOne of the first things that we noticed was the smell of the small enclosures, mainly the ones that had ponds or any kind of water in them.","11176":"The water is green, smelly and stagnant and does not look fit for animals to be living in.","11177":"There was a distinct lack of animals!","11178":"Several enclosures were empty and the ones that had any animals in looked depressing and too small, especially for larger animals like the panda or tiger.","11179":"On site facilitiesThe toilet blocks are very small with queues constantly forming.","11180":"There are a couple of different cafe\/restaurants that are over priced (as expected) and a limited amount of seating for you to eat your meal.","11181":"ConclusionVery disappointed with Edinburgh zoo.","11182":"I wouldn't advise anyone to visit this place.","11183":"I have visited the Zoo on the 12th of April 2019 with my family ( wife and my 2 daughters ).","11184":"We didn't had the experience we have hoped for as we couldn't see most of the animals...","11185":"the Zoo looked like being kind of abandoned... maybe a tiny bit of a desolate place.","11186":"I wouldn't have normally complain about it but we have paid nearly \u00a3 50 for... not too much.","11187":"As I'd broken a couple of bones in my foot, I was in a wheelchair when we went.","11188":"We'd booked a ticket online and were warmly welcomed by the staff.","11189":"Helpfully, they gave us a map which showed the best route for disabled visitors.","11190":"They also suggested that we took their mobility vehicle up to the top of the zoo as it would then be a downward slope back to the entrance\/exit.","11191":"The animals were clearly well cared for","11192":"and it was great to see koalas; they have a special enclosure as they need peace and quiet to remain unstressed.","11193":"Sadly, the pandas were hiding that day but all the other animals, including rhino, lion and tiger, were very much in evidence; the penguin pool is huge.","11194":"We had some lovely soup for lunch in one of the cafes and, again, the staff were friendly and helpful.","11195":"We enjoyed our day out and, even though it was the Easter holidays and there were plenty of visitors, it was easy to get around and to see everything we wanted to.","11196":"The zoo is fun and a great day out.","11197":"Over priced though and merch and food is expensive.","11198":"We enjoy our annual visit here","11199":"Brilliant zoo with loads to see and learn about.","11200":"The hill gets fairly steep the further in you go but does give lovely views from the top.","11201":"We adored the Sun Bears!","11202":"Access and parking are really not ideal.","11203":"Over priced but these places always are.","11204":"All built on a hill so expect lots of uphill walking.","11205":"Not easy with a pram.","11206":"Vast majority of enclosures were empty.","11207":"Children were very disappointed.","11208":"Thankfully we managed to see one panda at the end if the visit.","11209":"I went on a day it was raining so most of the animals were inside.","11210":"Not the zoos fault but a lot of money spent to only see a handful of animal.","11211":"The zoo is on a steep slope so is a bit of a trek to get round.","11212":"Was disappointed, but it might have been better if the weather was nice.","11213":"What a great day out with the children.","11214":"Staff are friendly, informative and happy to talk to the children about the animals.","11215":"The animals are varied and there is plenty of info available for every animal.","11216":"Great day out!","11217":"Animals looked well and happy.","11218":"Most people know the zoo is on a hill but the top area is extremely steep.","11219":"Hand rails would be of benefit there.","11220":"Signposting is poor in parts as not all animals are on the map or signs so it can be difficult to find certain animals.","11221":"We went to Edinburgh zoo as a family of five, grandma, parents, and 2 children.","11222":"The zoo is absolutely lovely but is incredibly hilly so be prepared to ache the next day!","11223":"The animals were clearly very well looked after, we particularly enjoyed seeing the 2 pandas.","11224":"The koalas are definitely worth a look also.","11225":"The only reason I didn\u2019t rate 5 stars, is that I felt there could\u2019ve been a few more animals.","11226":"Perhaps they were sleeping?","11227":"We prepaid our tickets but then ended up in a much longer queue than those paying on the day but didn't have to wait to long before arriving inside.","11228":"The zoo is sited on a steep incline but the landscaping and selection of exhibits on the way keep you entertained as you go around.","11229":"There is a good selection of animals but not all are very easy to see.","11230":"Appreciate that you can't be guaranteed to see the pandas but as the zoos main attraction, it was disappointing not to be able to catch s go in moss nonetheless - especially as we had travelled from Cornwall.","11231":"We did just find the zoo incredibly overcrowded with people even taking into account the school hols.","11232":"The cafes were crowded - including people eating their own picnics - and very expensive.","11233":"\u00a31.50 for a small packet of crisps!","11234":"Overall, we were left underwhelmed but the location etc probably means they don't have to try too hard!","11235":"The zoo has made many improvements over the years since I was last here and is a great visit on a day out.","11236":"You can see the animals are well treated and the zoo others many great viewing options to walk around and see as much of the animals as possible.","11237":"The penguins and panda are a must when here","11238":"Had an amazing time seeing some all kinds of animals.","11239":"Most Zoos have the typical animals, Edinburgh has some unusual ones e.g. Pygmy Hippo, Pandas and other local wildlife.","11240":"We visited this week as we was on holiday In the area, weve visited quite alot of zoo's and this one is definitely one of my favourites!","11241":"The que to get in with the car took quite a while as you have to que on the main road for access which was abit of a pain, there seemed to be a lack of toilets right near the entrance\/exit  2 ladies and 1 men's\/baby change\/disabled which got very busy.","11242":"However we had a fantastic day, we saw the panda once asleep on its back when we first arrived  and the next time before we left it was sat up eating which was great to see.","11243":"Another highlight for me was seeing the baby koala .","11244":"It's very hilly so wear comfortable shoes!","11245":"There was plenty of picnic areas dotted around.","11246":"The park was very clean and tidy.","11247":"We would definitely visit again if we're in the area again","11248":"What a wonderful zoo!","11249":"A huge place with lovely, big enclosures for all the animals.","11250":"Plenty of animals to see and places to eat.","11251":"Well worth a visit !","11252":"Enjoyable visit, there was a huge queue to enter the park which went all the way into the car park.","11253":"Staff were great","11254":"but I suggest buying your tickets online before going as we were allowed to skip the whole queue.","11255":"It\u2019s \u00a34 to park the car in the car park.","11256":"Great wee park for the kids to play and plenty places to eat.","11257":"Kids loved it !","11258":"My family of animal-loving children are veterans of zoo-visiting.","11259":"This one rated well in their estimation, with unusual animals such as koala bears and a giant panda.","11260":"The penguin parade was great too.","11261":"Only observation was that more signposting is needed.","11262":"Quite frustrating going down dead ends, and the signs there are not matching up with the map, etc.Animals seem well cared for.","11263":"Friendly, helpful staff.","11264":"I truly recommend everyone to try a zookeeper experience!","11265":"It was absolutely amazing and worth every penny.","11266":"Started by getting close to a armadillo, continued by cleaning the gibbons enclosure, followed by feeding the penguins, preparing the food enrichments for meerkats and also trained a cuscus :))","11267":"An absolute treat for my daughter\u2019s very memorable 8th Birthday.","11268":"Wow, what a nice experience that was !!","11269":"When we turned up there was a huge queue","11270":"and I was reading the wait","11271":"but it moved so quickly!","11272":"Very efficient and such friendly helpful staff!","11273":"The animals have lots of room as I find some zoos quite enclosed and a bit cruel, but this one had plenty of space for the animals to play and relax whilst we could look and on and enjoy their fun.","11274":"Vast displays of monkeys and the bears were a particular joy.","11275":"The food was the only let down, no choice and cold and inflated prices.","11276":"Plenty of good picnic spots though so pack a picnic and enjoy the sun would be my advice.","11277":"We\u2019ve visited the zoo a handful of times with the children.","11278":"I always think the prices are over priced for entrance and the fact you need to pay \u00a34 for parking!A lot of the animals looked miserable and some of the areas had nothing in them.","11279":"We visited the bird area where youcan feed the birds some sort of juice which they charge you a \u00a31 for a small cup!","11280":"I think this sort of thing should be free of charge at certain times of the day for children to have the experience!","11281":"Arrived with the kids for the usual walk round , we were lucky to find a Zoo Keeper who had a young Armadillo running about ,interesting to see the fur on its underside .","11282":",The lions and hippos were out and a couple of Rhinos in the open air .","11283":"The aviary was good and the baboons were play fighting all in all a good morning out","11284":"A great family trip to the zoo today - although a bit cold the kids & adults were kept entertained by all the different animals.","11285":"All animals looked happy & well cared for.","11286":"The hits for us were the pandas, rhinos and penguins!!!","11287":"(Although penguin parade was a bit of a let down).","11288":"Spent a good 5 hours.","11289":"Will visit again.","11290":"Thanks","11291":"Nice zoo although built on a big hill.","11292":"A lot of the animals were in their houses as it was pouring with rain!","11293":"Spent several hours here, would have spent more had the weather permitted.","11294":"You do need to plan your day properly to make the most out of the keeper talks\/parade\/etc.  I also recommend booking your tickets ahead if possible.","11295":"The enclosures were all clean, and generously sized where possible.","11296":"I spent some time chatting with a keeper while she was sorting something in the armadillo pen, she was more than happy to answer my questions, even recognised me at the end of my trip and asked how I'd enjoyed the day, plus recommended another wildlife park to visit, sadly I didn't get her name but kudos to her!","11297":"Had a great time at our visit to the zoo.","11298":"Saw lots of animals and up quite close too!","11299":"Kids loved the penguin parade even if it was one penguin stealing all the limelight!","11300":"We were also lucky enough to see the pandas which was so lovely to see!","11301":"Our local zoo is Chester zoo so we couldn't help but make comparisons - a little smaller I think but what it lacked in space it made up for in animals, close encounters, knowledgeable staff who gave great talks (man with beard and long hair followed the hippo talk with 2 more about the bears and a bird which were so interesting and his variety of knowledge was impressive!), and all round a great experience.","11302":"My only downfall was the the fact it's based on a hill, which with a toddler in a buggy and 6 year old dragging his feet made it a little difficult but having said that the views from the hilltop point were spectacular, so not really a negative!!","11303":"Would love to return if we were back in the area again!!","11304":"Really enjoyed myself, I loved seeing all the beautiful animals.","11305":"Surprising a larger zoo, than I thought.","11306":"Animal enclosures looked well kept and clean.","11307":"Zoo staff very helpful when we enquired what cafes were open.","11308":"Saw two beautiful pandas.","11309":"Loved the zoo, weather wasn\u2019t great","11310":"but we still managed to have a great time.","11311":"Wide range of animals including the pandas !!","11312":"Definitely recommend it for the kids","11313":"Loved the zoo, lots to see and do, could have spent the day there.","11314":"The boys loved the animals.","11315":"The penguin parade was more like 4 penguins but nevertheless was entertaining to see them wobbling about.","11316":"The panda came out for a poo and we got to see it parading itself in the warm sunshine.","11317":"Loved the new restaurant and table service made all the difference to tired legs.","11318":"We visited Edinburgh zoo on Wednesday 3\/04It was a very wet day but that didn\u2019t stop us (they sell ponchos in the gift shop for \u00a32.50 each - very reasonable)Before","11319":"we went I was a bit wary after reading all the bad reviews, but went with the attitude of it is what you make it!I wasn\u2019t disappointed, the penguin parade was a lot of fun and we spent 4 hours having a lovely wander round.","11320":"I can see why people would be angry about the lack of animals ( no giraffes or elephants)The animals that are there can\u2019t be forced to come out and about all the time, so I suppose it\u2019s just luck whether you see them or not!We luckily got to see lots of animals including the pandas!!Overall we had a fab day, but there is deffo room for improvement!","11321":"Would be nice to a bigger variety of animal.","11322":"Still worth a visit!!- Beware though it is all up a very steep hill, but they do have a Mobilty car that they use to take you to the top if you ask, as long as you can manage getting down.","11323":"We visited the zoo today for our sons 7th birthday and we all left very disappointed.","11324":"There are not many animals, the zoo looks tired and unfortunately the hills made this a bit of a disaster.","11325":"Only a small number of food outlets were open and menu very limited.","11326":"Edinburgh zoo has the potential to show off their animals like the giant pandas, koalas and red pandas but they appear not to have the passion or flare to make this into an amazing place.","11327":"Our son thought it was the worst zoo he has visited, and we have been to quite a few as he is very passionate about animals.","11328":"\u00a319.95 for an adult to get in.","11329":"Luckily I had the train offer for a free child.","11330":"Hardly any animals here.","11331":"The tiger looked bored pacing up and down.","11332":"No reptile house,  not clear that reptile show, if you can call it that is in the chimpanzee lecture theatre.","11333":"No giraffes or elephants.","11334":"I wouldn't go back.","11335":"Nice zoo, but hills make it really hard if travelling with young children.","11336":"Disappointed not to see the Pandas,even though it was a lovely day.","11337":"Only outside viewing available and they decided not to come outside.","11338":"Also viewing some of the animals was to far away, chimpanzees etc.","11339":"And only saw 1!","11340":"It's a nice zoo but could do with updating.","11341":"Lovely Sunday visit with the family at the end of February.","11342":"The weather was brilliant which does help as it is of course mostly out doors.","11343":"Very pretty views if you can make it to the top of the hill.","11344":"We planned ahead and pre booked tickets which i would encourage anyone to do as the standard queue was big when we got there and it had literally just opened.","11345":"Lots of good animals with the tiger and sun bears being my favourite.","11346":"Good play park for the kids also.","11347":"I would suggest taking a picnic and eating this at the picnic area beside the tigers.","11348":"From here you get a great view of the tiger and another park for the kids to play.","11349":"My 19 month old was amazed with the penguins.","11350":"My main gripe is the changing facilities are crap and they really need to update these and the toilets in general.","11351":"Restaurant food looked poor so glad we took our picnic.","11352":"We've arrived before gates were open.","11353":"As an objective we set all big cats\/panda\/koala bears.","11354":"Not only we've managed to see them without elbowing\/pusing around, animals too were roaming around their enclosures.","11355":"Kids absolutely loved it.","11356":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo whilst in Edinburgh on a weekend break recently and we loved it!The animals have lovely enclosures that mean that, whilst you can get close to them, they still have plenty of space.","11357":"A real highlight for me was the Tiger and the Giant Panda.","11358":"The only slight downside, which didn\u2019t affect us but may affect others, is how hilly the zoo is.","11359":"I saw plenty of people with pushchairs, small children and wheel chairs who found the steep hills a little more challenging.","11360":"Overall, a fabulous day out!","11361":"Expensive zoo with hardly any animalsWalked round all the enclosures and what a disappointment seen hardly any animalsWe travelled 3 hours to get there and left after 2 hours","11362":"The talks were excellent and very informative.","11363":"You can even handle some reptiles and insects at some of the talks.","11364":"We had a great day but unfortunately the pandas weren\u2019t on display.","11365":"You can get the bus airlink 100 from Edinburgh.","11366":"This was a hugely disappointing visit to Edinburgh zoo.","11367":"On arrival, with one ticket desk open and only 1 other family group ahead of us, it took 10 minutes to buy a ticket.","11368":"If it was peak season with a massive queue, I could understand.","11369":"But after queuing for 10 minutes at the ticket desk, 1 of 3, we were told they don\u2019t sell tickets at this desk by the lady, and we had to go to another customer service desk, all whilst the man at the customer service desk seen us standing and getting impatient and not calling us over.","11370":"So not a good start, to try to get in.","11371":"Once the saga of the tickets was over, it was largely disappointing and very run down; the cafes were closed and restaurants closed (if they ever open), most of the animal enclosures are empty inside and out (where are the animals ?), we seen monkeys, tigers and zebras and the panda viewing was closed off so couldn\u2019t even see them.","11372":"Overall for \u00a339 for 2 adults, I want a refund and I will come back when the zoo is functioning as a zoo.","11373":"Lovely day out with my family, travelled a very long way and heard about the zoo!","11374":"With three very different ages of children, there was something for everyone.","11375":"We came to Edinburgh mainly to see the Pandas at the Zoo as they\u2019re both mine and my partners favourite animal.","11376":"It was less busy than i imagined it would be which meant there was always room to see all the animals that were still in their indoor areas.","11377":"The Only downside was we had to walk up a lot of steep hills.","11378":"Lots of great Animals and the only Giant Pandas in the UK.","11379":"Fun Day Out.","11380":"Easy to get to on the 26 bus and it drops you outside.","11381":"The zoo itself was lovely, very clean, staff all very friendly and informative.","11382":"Plenty of animals that look well looked after.","11383":"We had a really lovely day.","11384":"We picked a really good day to go in February when the weather was so good, most people had jackets off to walk around & it was so busy with people eating on grass.","11385":"Love seeing all the animals","11386":"We came here whilst visiting Edinburgh for my dads retirement present.","11387":"Lovely zoo and plenty of animals to see.","11388":"It is on a hill and can be steep at times.","11389":"They did offer my grandma a ride up the hill free of charge (the tractor is seasonal) for mobility purposes but she was sure she\u2019d be okay.","11390":"Staff were polite and friendly, we had a lovely family day out.","11391":"Came for the panda and weren\u2019t disappointed.","11392":"Lovely zoo, nice and clean and a large variety of animals.","11393":"The zoo is on a steep hill so bear this in mind when coming with kids or wheelchairs etc.Other that, lovely and would definitely recommend.","11394":"Myself my husband and two children aged 12 and 8 went for a day trip to the zoo.","11395":"We arrived at ten and didn't leave to closing time.","11396":"It is fairly steep but plenty of seating and exhibits to see along the way.","11397":"We were lucky it was a dry day and got some beautiful views across Edinburgh.","11398":"Staff were very pleasant and happy to talk about the animals.","11399":"Great shop were you can spend as much or as little as you want","11400":"Failure to mention that a lot of animals could not be seen while paying for tickets.","11401":"A lot of good places closed.","11402":"The three stars is purely for the lovely staff in the monkey house at the end.","11403":"Really worth a visit.","11404":"Beautiful scenery if you go to the top of the hill.","11405":"Big enclosures and really good, concise information plaques.","11406":"It was really nice to read about how the zoo is helping with conservation and protection of each species in the zoo .","11407":"Loads of recycling bins everywhere.","11408":"Just brilliant!","11409":"We loved our time at Edinburgh Zoo despite our age, why should the youngsters have all the fun \ud83d\ude01.","11410":"We took it steady so the hills didn't beat us and thoroughly enjoyed the animals, views and surroundings.","11411":"Particular highlights included the Squirrel Monkeys, the penguins (disappointing that they didn't want to come out on parade but we understood) and the Tiger.","11412":"We will be going back again at some point to catch up with our 'friends'","11413":"Absolutely love this Zoo. Penguin, monkey, kangaroo and more.","11414":"Great place  spent all day out.","11415":"See u soon animals","11416":"Heading straight for the pandas ...","11417":"the walk up to the big cats was quiet steep but doable ...","11418":"wallaby\u2019s were closed due to Icy paths got a bit lost and went round and round the monkeys until I found where I was going but thoroughly enjoyed my day there ... got to see pandas the tiger and koalas so left feeling happy as that\u2019s what I came to see as well as the other animals of course !!","11419":"Good day no matter the weather the animals didn\u2019t seem to care.","11420":"What a brilliant zoo.","11421":"The animals all had plenty of space and were well looked after.","11422":"There were staff everywhere cleaning enclosures and feeding animals.","11423":"The zoo was clean and well-maintained.","11424":"It is very hilly though so wear comfy shoes!","11425":"They do offer assistance if needed and check this with you when you arrive.","11426":"Plenty of toilet facilities and places to eat.","11427":"Well signposted and useful map.","11428":"Lots of animals you rarely see.","11429":"Brilliant talks with knowledgeable, friendly staff.","11430":"Definitely one of the best zoos we have been to and well worth a long trip up here.","11431":"Went mainly for the pandas... nothing on the website to say that they weren\u2019t available to view, but only got told AFTER we paid that they weren\u2019t on.","11432":"Animals look bored and depressed.","11433":"Tiny zoo.","11434":"No food places open.","11435":"Not worth the money.","11436":"Won\u2019t be going again or recommending it.","11437":"Awful.","11438":"Very good and has a lot of interesting animal unfortunately we came too see the pandas but not lucky the toots were having there check up though we still saw the penguins cool as bits well worth a visit","11439":"Was a regular visitor to Edinburgh zoo as a child and decided that we must bring our granddaughter to the zoo to experience the same enjoyment.","11440":"Our visit was a disappointment .There","11441":"was less animals and those that we did see didn\u2019t look very content.","11442":"The signage at times was confusing and we missed seeing some of the enclosures.","11443":"We did check the website in advance regarding seeing the pandas and it stated that they would be available to see.","11444":"However when we arrived at the zoo a sign told us they were not available to be seen.","11445":"Certainly will not be visiting again.","11446":"Not value for money.","11447":"After getting my 2 year old daughter excited for a day at the zoo she was left disappointed.","11448":"The panda enclosure was closed even though on the website it was stated that it was closed till Thursday 14th March and today was Friday 15th.","11449":"We had to make up a story about why we couldn\u2019t see them to her!","11450":"She was excited to see the penguin parade, however, this was not what it used to be and the 3 penguins only came out of one gate and into another!The tiger was a hit and so were the flamingos!","11451":"A lot of monkeys too!","11452":"Couldn\u2019t see the rhino, don\u2019t know where he was hiding!Some staff were fantastic and very knowledgable, however as it was a very cold wet day someone from the discovery centre was out telling us there were activities for the children to do inside, off we headed only to be confronted by rude woman asking us what we were doing here.","11453":"When we explained they told us we should be using the side door not this entrance!Would I return?","11454":"No!","11455":"I have visited much better zoos.","11456":"This was our third visit and new experiences every time.","11457":"The pandas were having their vet check so couldn\u2019t see them but these checks need to be done.","11458":"The tiger bridge wow we couldn\u2019t have timed it better as he walked over our heads amazing.","11459":"We went to all the talks and really enjoyed them.","11460":"Really sorry I don\u2019t know the name of the guy who did them all","11461":"but he was brilliant and really friendly.","11462":"Rained quite a bit but still we saw a lot of the animals.","11463":"Third but not final visit.","11464":"This zoo seems to cater for the animals they look after,and the enclosure provide lots of space,the staff and volunteers are helpful knowledgeable and friendly.","11465":"The only thing I didn\u2019t like was the garden areas could do with some maintenance and tidying up,also the zoo has lots of steep walks to get to the top part of the zoo","11466":"Panda's and penguins what not to love!Only saw one of the panda's and it was asleep with the occasional stretch!Penguins were super cute and lots of information on the way they live etc.","11467":"Underwater viewing area was good.","11468":"Koala's were cute too,","11469":"It was lovely however they lacked a lot of animals, giraffes, reptile enclosure, elephants were just a few to name.","11470":"It was the same price as Chester Zoo.","11471":"They were no staff members walking around to ask for help or what way to find what animal.","11472":"Chester Zoo i would pay \u00a320 but not here.","11473":"It's a very nice zoo and good if you want to get your steps in.","11474":"When I visited they had a BABY KOALA, BABY TAPIER AND BABY MONKEYS!","11475":"I love animals especially the cute baby's.","11476":"the food was nice, the atmosphere was lovely, and I could easily spend the day here.","11477":"Got there at 11am left at 4pm but could have easily spent longer wondering around xx","11478":"We really enjoyed our visit to Edinburgh Zoo.","11479":"It's important to note that parts of the zoo are very hilly and the enclosures in these areas are quite well spaced out, so this means a lot of walking!","11480":"We ate at two cafes on the site and enjoyed our lunch (and cake) in both of them.","11481":"It was great to see Yang Guang; unfortunately we were not allowed to view the pandas inside","11482":"but I understand that areas are closed off sometimes in the best interest of the animals.","11483":"I would definitely visit again!","11484":"Yes we were lucky enough to see both Panda's,inside and outside of their enclosures, but that was as good as it got.","11485":"I've been to Chester zoo and Flamingo land zoo and both are far superior to this in respect of the size and quality of space and enclosure that the animals are housed in.","11486":"I felt very sad too see how a lot of the animals were kept.","11487":"My friend and I had expected to spend most of the day there but walked round the whole zoo in just over 2 hours.","11488":"I won't be recommending it too anyone I know.","11489":"Sorry.","11490":"Well we had traveled a fair distance to see the pandas , they had a nice enclosure butNo entry was allowed on the platform.","11491":"The penguin but was closed, the kolas where not accessible, some bit were okayHard walk.i would recommend other zoosThe manager didn\u2019t care and no staff to be seen","11492":"If the weather helps it would be better to enjoy this activity than doing it on a rainy or cold day.","11493":"We had a look almost on every animal in the Zoo.","11494":"It looked well organized according to the size of the area or so we thought!","11495":"After our walk what we did not like was that some animals especially the big ones like panda, tiger, rhinoceros were very very low on energy, tired, trapped, like they needed more space around them.","11496":"Other smaller animals as well looked so sad, some areas also were very dirty and smelly.","11497":"Overall we left with a heart brake as well like those animals felt.","11498":"Pity...","11499":"Visited Edinburgh Zoo in February and had a fantastic day put.","11500":"The staff are very friendly and helpful and we saw an amazing amount of animals despite the cold weather.","11501":"We had a really enjoyable day and it was excellent value for money","11502":"Have been a Life Member of the RZSS for many, many years.","11503":"Although I don\u2019t live in Edinburgh anymore - it\u2019s always a place I visit.","11504":"Gone are the days of taking friends their for silver service lunch in The Mansion House.","11505":"However things move on.","11506":"The march of progress.","11507":"Had a great talk at the Tiger Enclosure by (I presume) the cat curator.","11508":"The best way to stop a tiger attacking is to stare fully into it\u2019s eyes.","11509":"I would not want to be in the position to try it out.","11510":"Very informative though.","11511":"I would encourage all who read this to take out an Annual Membership to help Wildlife Conservation.","11512":"Or how about adopting one of the collection?","11513":"This was our third visit to the zoo since having children.","11514":"We went as part of a birthday treat for my daughters 10th birthday.","11515":"The kids were extremely excited as they both love animals and we went with great expectations as our previous 2 trips had been great.","11516":"Unfortunately we found a significant drop in standards.","11517":"We began our morning at the entrance with the meerkats listening to a talk which mainly focused on a keeper telling us the real reason they had them...\u201dbecause of a certain car insurance advert\u201d.","11518":"\ud83e\udd14We quickly moved up further into the park to  handle some reptiles which the kids enjoyed.","11519":"The chimpanzees looked totally bored and genuinely sad.","11520":"We then went across to see the pandas and my heart broke, the male was outside pacing round and round in circles repeatedly stopping to stand and stare at the wall.","11521":"This was the same with the rhino.","11522":"Lots of the animals didn\u2019t make an appearance and there were lots of empty pens.","11523":"We travelled up from Berwick-upon-Tweed fully expecting to spend a full day there but left after only 3 hours.","11524":"Not a long time considering the cost.","11525":"Sadly we won\u2019t return, which is a shame as previously we have thoroughly enjoyed our visits.","11526":"I am fully aware that animals should not be contained in a zoo and appreciate that experiences with animals should be within their natural environment wherever possible, however I\u2019m disappointed that Edinburgh zoo doesn\u2019t seem to be maintaining the up keep of the site.","11527":"Therefore providing the best possible living conditions for the animals.","11528":"Been multiple times and never disappointed, always spend hours here even when it\u2019s quiet definitely worth the money","11529":"It\u2019s a good day out.","11530":"Going during the off season is better than going in the summer.","11531":"The crowds are less.","11532":"We visited the zoo for a day during our stay here, it was a brilliant day.","11533":"The animals had good enclosures with plenty of space for them to roam and be happy.","11534":"The Giant Panda, Koala Bears and the recent Baby Tapir were a highlight of the day.","11535":"The food court was unfortunately closed so we decided on one of the other restaurants.","11536":"However we did have some issues at the restaurant for lunch, we had to send our meals back twice before switching to a different meal which was lovely but not our preferred choice.","11537":"We would love to come back and see the penguin parade as the penguins didn't feel up to it while we were there due to nesting.","11538":"Had a great day out at the zoo with friends.","11539":"We went on a weekday so the zoo was very quiet.","11540":"The zoo and animals were brilliant and the staff were superb.","11541":"We were however slightly disappointed and shocked at the cost of the food.","11542":"For two paninis, two packets of crisps and two hot drinks was just shy of \u00a320.","11543":"We expect it to be expensive however when the oven was broken and we couldn\u2019t have hot paninis it seemed very expensive.","11544":"There were signed to say this in the cafe to highlight this.","11545":"We would return and bring our own picnic next time.","11546":"The zoo was everything I expected we came here just to see the pandas as it was a my birthday was very good experience would definitely come again","11547":"the  majority of animals we viewed seemed to be low on energy .large zoo but not clean enclosures and overflowing food","11548":"bowls.rotten food in cages smelt horrible.and it was not suitable for people with walking difficulties.","11549":"Expect a tiring day but worthwhile.","11550":"Great range of animals and things to do, lots of good information.","11551":"A lovely day out.","11552":"Very nice zoo.","11553":"Suitable spaces for animals.","11554":"Many rarities: panda, koala, goral, sun bear and many more.","11555":"I liked having a look at the research on primates.","11556":"The animals voluntarily participate in the player's tasks in the hope of a reward snack.","11557":"One of the main attractions is the penguin parade.","11558":"On the day of our visit, the penguins were not interested in people.","11559":"We enjoyed our visit here.","11560":"Reasonably priced entry and considering we went in February the zoo was busy.","11561":"Lots to see and do and plenty for all ages.","11562":"We have been before and remembered the site being more hilly, either that or we are a bit fitter than last time!","11563":"It is quite a hard walk and I am not sure it is suitable for buggies or wheelchairs - though accessible vehicles and drop off points are readily available.","11564":"Our daughter loved the tiger and penguin areas and it was great to be able to walk through the penguin enclosure.","11565":"Other areas were also open to walk through which is much better than just looking through glass.","11566":"We sent best part of a day there and even though a lot of the seasonal snack bars were closed we managed to get food and a seat in the main food area.","11567":"Been a while since we had been but we would go back again soon, Great place","11568":"Just your normal zoo that can be found in most places.","11569":"Nothing special.","11570":"Very very hilly.....Not for people with walking difficulties","11571":"Whilst the pandas were great to visit (and perhaps the main reason we came) the rest of the Zoo is looking shabby and in much need of refurbishment.","11572":"Some enclosures were empty with no notice given.","11573":"The food options were limited and obscenely expensive.","11574":"We paid over three pounds for an egg roll that was served cold as the oven wasn\u2019t working.","11575":"Decorations were being taken down from a previous event and left hanging around.","11576":"All in all we felt that we had been vastly overcharged.","11577":"We won\u2019t be returning.","11578":"We had the best day here..","11579":"The staff were amazing and so passionate about getting the message out about how get involved in conservation.","11580":"The talks were fascinating, particularly the insects.","11581":"It is the best zoo we have visited.","11582":"We loved the lorikeets and they were one of the many highlights.","11583":"The Bali starling was beautiful.","11584":"Came here last Saturday for the day - incredibly disappointed.","11585":"I've visited zoos all over the world and this has to be the worst for animal conditions - by a long shot.","11586":"The majority of animals we viewed seemed low on energy \/ depressed and enclosures seemed unkept and tbh really dirty.","11587":"I found it really distressing - animals, in particular, included: Pandas, Zebras, Owls, Big Cats, Monkeys and mostly the Rhino.","11588":"The Rhino seemed so down \/ depressed and his enclosure did not feel adequate - even in comparison the other UK Zoos - such as Chester \/ Yorkshire Wildlife Park the difference is unbelievable.","11589":"In the Owl enclosure - they did not seem to have any way to hide away from the beaming sun light - which looked as though they were distressed as they attempted to look the other way to escape the sun - there were also two magpies that seemed to access in and out this enclosure.","11590":"The Duck enclosure - also was full of over-flowing food bowls labelled 'Duck' but also plenty of rotting food laying in the water within their enclosure.","11591":"All the Chimpanzees\/Monkeys we came across seemed so fatigue \/ depressed \/ sad - their cages were also full of rotten food and smelt quite horrific.","11592":"The best enclosure by far was the Scottish Wild Cats - which they seemed well kept and it showed in their personalities.","11593":"I found the entire visit extremely distressing, and after further investigation, it seems this has been an ongoing issue with this zoo for a long period of time.","11594":"Something really needs to be done.","11595":"I have seen that this zoo is the second biggest revenue for tourist attractions in Scotland - I would really hope that this began to fund better conditions for these animals - there has surely got to be a standard!","11596":"The zoo just appears on the road side as you are driving down the main road but its such a hidden gem!","11597":"You have to be prepared for walking on a hill though!","11598":"Staff very friendly and cheerful.","11599":"We had got corporate tickets and so got in straight away.","11600":"Abbie who greeted us was very friendly and gave us a few timings of the events and what to see.","11601":"Enclosures are a good size and all really well looked after.","11602":"Even though it was busy because of half term it didn't seem crowded.","11603":"still plenty of room to walk around and lots of viewing points for the animals.","11604":"Unfortunately the penguins did not want to walk around for their parade but they don't get forced which was also good to see.","11605":"it was a great day out and would recommend.","11606":"Definitely worth a visit!","11607":"Very easy to walk around the zoo, we were provided with a map to help us.","11608":"There is also a lot of food places too!","11609":"We\u2019re staying at the hotel next door to the zoo, so we thought we\u2019d pop over for a bit.","11610":"If you show your room key after 2pm you get 50% off the ticket price and free parking so it worked out about \u00a310 each.","11611":"There is a large selection of animals which seemed well cared for.","11612":"Great views at the top of the park too","11613":"The Zoo is looking very shabby and tired  with investment much needed, which considering the cost of \u00a350 for 2 adults and a child, should have been done long ago.","11614":"They include an \"optional\" 10% charity donation in the entrance fee which considering the prices is debatable.","11615":"My main gripe is the lack of animals.","11616":"Many enclosures are either empty or you can't spot them due to their being only 1 animal in the enclosure, namely  the Tiger and Rhino, who if deciding to rest being a tree, makes them hard to spot.","11617":"The lions were also absent on the day.","11618":"The Zoo is on a main residential street and parking was full when we arrived so we had to park nearby away from the zoo.","11619":"The Zoo is also on a steep incline so if you have kids in a pushchair, be prepared to struggle up the worn uneven paths.","11620":"Small children will also find it tough going so be prepared to carry them.","11621":"Many of the enclosure windows are also quite high so lifting your child up so see the animals is common, not good considering its their target market.","11622":"All in all, its expensive compared to other, more modern zoos, and is relying on its central location to attract visitors.","11623":"I wouldn't return.","11624":"Pricey family day out, yes it\u2019s got panda\u2019s","11625":"but some parts are shabby n need a real bit of tlc, and for the cost better family day outs are about, and limited opening hours","11626":"My friend and I came to Edinburgh to celebrate my 30th birthday, we decided to visit the zoo on my birthday due to my love of zoo's.","11627":"I have visited many zoo's around the world and this one was by far the worst.","11628":"Firstly, the grounds of the zoo are run down and the signage is completely confusing.","11629":"Secondly, the animals (if you get to see them) seem tired and sad which broke my friends heart (the zebras in particular who were static and seemed frozen).","11630":"The space in which the animals are kept were small and in need of some tender loving care.","11631":"Finally, the amount of empty enclosures were way too high for my liking.","11632":"So if you are a real animal\/zoo lover do not visit this zoo.","11633":"Edinburgh Zoo is definitely worth a visit.","11634":"The entry prices and cafe prices are pretty good.","11635":"The zoo is quite sloped so beware that the whole zoo probably isn\u2019t wheelchair accessible, although there is a shuttle which can take wheelchair users to the top of the zoo.","11636":"The enclosures here are good, although some of the primate enclosures are a bit on the small side.","11637":"The zoo houses the UK\u2019s only Giant Pandas which are great to see.","11638":"The penguins are very fun to watch.","11639":"Parking is available but at a charge.","11640":"Easy online booking with discounts for students.","11641":"Long queue to enter even with pre booked tickets and some confusion as to where to queue.","11642":"Customers trying to filter in from the walkway caused conflict for those who had queued along the path near the stairs though to be fair it wasnt clear as where to queue and no barrier in place.","11643":"Good to see the tiger so clearly and children loved the monkeys playing.","11644":"Appeared to be a few empty habitats but all animals looked well cared for and had tidy enclosures with plenty of food.","11645":"Food portions for children were nearly equivalent to adults whuch I thought were quite expensive for what they were.","11646":"Empty plates though so were enjoyed.","11647":"Liked use of mobility car especially as very hilly but sometines a wait to access this.","11648":"No chimps, And we didnt get to see the panda but all in all worth a visit","11649":"Visit the zoo on 19\/02\/19, after purchasing tickets earlier on line you would expect a more fluid process of entry to a major attraction, sadly this is not the case at Edinburgh Zoo.","11650":"There are 2 queues in place one for those paying on the day (tills staffed by 4 members of staff) and another queue for those with pre paid tickets (staffed by 1!), these queues seem to split only at the main entrance with queues then forming upto the car park and down the front stairs to the main entrance, this caused confusion and members of staff were not present to assist and those entering the building shrugged customers off from answering queries and ran into the building, we witnessed a bit of arguing between customers during waiting.","11651":"Upon entering the zoo as per previous reviews parts are looking tired and in need of refreshing with several empty enclosures however the range of animals is good.","11652":"It was disappointing to find a number of paths closed during the visit and a lot of contractor activity being undertaken including the removal of some previous display installations and also the tree felling being carried out in the chimpanzee enclosure meaning this whole outdoor enclosure was closed!","11653":"Could these works not be carried out outside of opening hours (under flood lighting)??","11654":"As others have also mentioned the penguin parade was a non event due to injections the previous day so this was disappointing and not mentioned at entry\/ticket purchase.","11655":"The zoo is on a hill so could be quite demanding on some visitors but this was not an issue for us.","11656":"The highlights of our visit included the Pandas, Tiger on a prowl and the baboons playing\/fighting.","11657":"I would advise anyone visiting to take you own food as very pricey inside (2 kids fish and chips and 3 drinks over \u00a320!).","11658":"I would visit again but would be in the future hopefully after further investment!","11659":"This was a lovely zoo to visit.","11660":"Great animals that seemed happy and well cared for in good conditions.","11661":"We ate in the food court, the food was good although the children portion seemed to come with more chips than the adults (see picture) and the staff seem to wear blue gloves constantly (even when touching their own faces and handles) which renders them a little pointless.","11662":"The zoo however is a great day out and there were many other food locations to chose from!","11663":"The zoo is a great place to visit.","11664":"As members of Chester Zoo we get into Edinburgh once a year for free and we love it.","11665":"A different experience to Chester but lovely.","11666":"It's hilly, so be aware, but definitely worth a visit.","11667":"Typical!","11668":"The day of the penguin's annual health check was the day we chose to visit (there was a brief notice on the website and we were informed when going in that the parade probably wouldn't be on) but there should still be plenty to see right?","11669":"On a cold and windy Edinburgh day there weren't many animals keen to be out and about though.","11670":"The day did gradually warm up and overall there was plenty to see.","11671":"If you've not been before prepare for plenty of walking up and down hill.","11672":"Highlights would still be the penguins, even without the parade, Sumatran tiger and monkey feeding time.","11673":"You can get a bit closer in some enclosures with walk through options (pelicans and wallaby off the top of my head).","11674":"Entry prices are discounted if you book online, and if you stay in the Holiday Inn next door you don't need to use the car park, plus you get 50% off entry after 2pm.","11675":"Strangely, most of the food concessions were closed while we were there.","11676":"Was a nice zoo, wasn\u2019t to busy.","11677":"Saw some great animal.","11678":"Giant Panda was a highlight.","11679":"There are better places out there but we still enjoyed it.","11680":"Had a brilliant day spent almost 5 hours walking around!","11681":"Even managed to get a video of one of the panda\u2019s doing a little roll over.","11682":"Saw a baby koala bear & Baby Tapir which was just the cutest thing ever!Food is the restaurant was expensive and not worth the money almost \u00a325 for kids fish & chips, hotdog & chips and 2 drinks!Defo recommend it one of the best Zoo\u2019s I\u2019ve been too but take a  picnic .","11683":"We visited today 21st","11684":"Feb.","11685":"My wife was so excited regarding pandas and sun bears and they didn\u2019t disappoint.","11686":"The zoo entrance is modern and staff extremely welcoming.","11687":"Whereas there were some amazing attractions there was also alot of frustration from alot of the visitors.1.","11688":"All animals are inside rather than outside, the list was pandas, all monkeys, tigers, meerkats, bearsMissing animals were the otters and lions.","11689":"On a lovely day like today this it questioned the zoo responsibility as all kids and family\u2019s were queuing and squashed to view animals inside.","11690":"The zoo layout is lovely but when over half the cages were empty this was frustrating for all.","11691":"Even the penguin march failed as they didnt want to come out.","11692":"We accept and respect the need for the work that Zoos do with regards to conversation and protection of endangered species and there is no doubt there is an absolute need for this work.","11693":"While the behind the scenes work is most likely state of the art or at the very least well informed and potentially ground breaking , some of the public facing aspects of Edinburgh zoo are very tired and in need of refurbishment - mainly the enclosures which are at times not great and pretty depressing to look at.","11694":"This said there clealy has been some investment in  areas such as  the chimpanzee house tiger and panda enclosures which are very good and well worth a look, but other enclosures are very small and, well, not the best aesthetically to be honest.","11695":"While on a negative thread the queue   management to get into the zoo is awful.","11696":"When we visited customers had to queue along the side of the building and up a hill towards the main car park but there is no management of the queue until customers get to within a few feet of the main entrance it was only then that it became clear that there is actually separate access for pre paid tickets and daily walk ups.","11697":"Rather frustrating when you have stood in a queue for ages and  watched people queue jump only to realise you could have been spared the ordeal it\u2019s better signage further away from the entrance.","11698":"If you go to the zoo with balance expectations knowing some of it is tatty it\u2019s not a bad day out.","11699":"Beware though it\u2019s on a significant hill so be prepared for some heafty climbs especially if you have a push chair or wheel chair.","11700":"It will be a work out and a half, but access idoes appear to be very wheelchair and pushchair friendly - with a hill workout included for free","11701":"Our visit to the zoo slightly disappointing .","11702":"Staff friendly and informative, however we found the zoo to look fairly run down and in need of a lot of refurbishment.","11703":"On a positive note we did take grandchild to see the giant panda\u2019s","11704":"and they did not disappoint.","11705":"Not somewhere we will be visiting again.","11706":"i went to the zoo on 19\/2\/19 with my 11 year old son ..","11707":"he loves zoos and this was our whole purpose of our stay in Edinburgh we have a yearly zoo pass for the Blackpool zoo (which is also","11708":"lovely)but we wanted to check out other zoos ..","11709":"The zoo is quite big ..","11710":"I hadn\u2019t been since i was 3 years old but i was pleasantly surprised it was lovely ..got to see the black n white pandas which are the only Black n white pandas in the uk I believe .The man doing the talk of the meerkats was a lovely man and loved hearing him tell us all about the meerkats..","11711":"he was quite funny and made the experience very enjoyable","11712":"Arrived at Edinburgh Zoo at 10.30am in half term week, didn\u2019t realise that you have to pay \u00a34 to park your car!","11713":"Every other zoo I have visited has free parking, so was very disappointed at this cost.","11714":"We hadn\u2019t pre-booked tickets, as it was a spontaneous trip, and the queue to get in was huge.","11715":"Again, I have never experienced this at any other zoo even in school holidays!","11716":"We queued for 45 minutes to get inside, surely during half term week it would be expected that lots of people would show up, so I\u2019m not sure why there wasn\u2019t a more efficient system in place?After a ropey start, we got inside and the animals made up for it.","11717":"The giant pandas and koalas were excellent to view, and we loved the tiger tunnel, where the tiger can walk right above your head!","11718":"We also enjoyed the wallaby enclosure where you are inside with the free roaming wallabies!The zoo is extremely hilly and steep to walk around, so anyone with mobility issues would need to make use of the offered assistance.","11719":"We have perhaps been spoilt with Chester Zoo and recent visits to the Cotswold Wildlife Park but this was a disappointing day out and poor in comparison.","11720":"We had to queue for ages for tickets  (having paid the \u00a34 parking charge) which was partly our fault as we didn\u2019t book online as didn\u2019t decide to visit until that morning (but the queue for pre-booked tickets was as long and slow moving).","11721":"Price was pretty steep - nearly \u00a350 for 3 of us including a 7 year old.","11722":"Lots of enclosures were empty and paths were shut and many animals were in hiding (probably due to the time of year","11723":"but it was a sunny day when we visited) with no means of viewing animals inside in many of the enclosures due to their style\/age.","11724":"Most of the eating places\/kiosks were closed which didn\u2019t affect us as we took our own food but there were no inside picnic areas that we could use and it was cold to be sat outside.","11725":"It was great to see some of the animals - managed one fast asleep panda, a fast asleep tiger and one awake lion!","11726":"Chimpanzee project was a highlight and a baby tapir was a first for us and very cute.","11727":"The penguin enclosure was also great but the \u2018parade\u2019 consisted of 2 penguins due to the fact that it was the mating season and they didn\u2019t want to come out!We returned to the panda enclosure about 3:15 to see if we could see an awake panda to be told that the inside area had shut.","11728":"We were warned that the inside viewing enclosures shut earlier than the main zoo but this seems too early when the zoo is only open until 4pm anyway.","11729":"There are new enclosures being built and work is obviously being done so hopefully this will improve the experience.","11730":"At the end of the day we are happy for money to go to supporting research and the protection of wildlife but wish this had lived up to expectations.","11731":"4 quid to park on top of the nearly 20 to get in.","11732":"Bit steep that.","11733":"Pre book online","11734":"and it saves you money on the entrance but you can only book for the following day so need to plan ahead.","11735":"Doing this can save you a 30 minute queue so it's well worth looking into.","11736":"We've been before quite a few years back so kind of knew what to expect.","11737":"The Zoo itself is on the side of a hill with enclosures and all kinds of other stuff dotted around.","11738":"It's steep up, and steep down but there are plenty of cross tracks and enclosures to look at on the way.","11739":"They have talks through the day (just like any other zoo) and are worth listening to.","11740":"There ate play areas all over for the kids.","11741":"The penguins have the biggest enclosure I've ever seen (I think I read somewhere the largest in Europe) but they didn't go for walkies when we were there.","11742":"Giant Pandas, big cats and a load of other stuff to see.","11743":"We never eat out at places like this so can't comment on any food issues.","11744":"Worth a go, bit pricey.","11745":"So the pros;1)","11746":"Giant Pandas.2) Koalas3)","11747":"PenguinsNow they do have 1 rhino, 2 Pygmy hippos and a cracking armadillo.","11748":"However due to the time of year there were loads of empty enclosures.","11749":"So onto the cons;1) Empty enclosures2) expensive for what it is.","11750":"Took us three and a half hours to do the whole thing.3) run down exhibits.","11751":"To be honest it\u2019s at best average, if you want a zoo then Chester is leaps and bounds ahead and to be fair Blackpool zoo has giraffe!","11752":"It's a great place I have been a few times now and love it every time.","11753":"If you are visiting Edinburgh I would recommend going to the zoo as it is a short bus journey from both the city center and the airport and is a good price","11754":"I visited the zoo nearly 14 years ago and it was fantastic.","11755":"This last visit,, I was very, very disappointed.","11756":"I genuinely lost count of the number of empty displays.","11757":"The whole place looks very tired, and although there is is work going on, and new attractions being built, the number of animals not on display was quite upsetting.","11758":"I\u2019m","11759":"so glad I didn\u2019t take out a membership, as tempting as it was before getting in.","11760":"It will be a good while before I contemplate returning.","11761":"Very disappointed","11762":"What a brilliant experience!","11763":"Attended as a family with friends and we had a great time.","11764":"The organization was excellent, the stage show was brilliant and the lanterns themselves were varies, beautifully crafted and made for a magical night.","11765":"The hot chocolate and toasted marshmallows were needed but it was Feb in Scotland!","11766":"This was the most amazing event, we loved every minute of it.","11767":"The food and mulled wine was perfect for keeping us warm.","11768":"I loved the way the exstinct animals were at the end and had a very powerful message.","11769":"Really hope this is back next year as we will definitely be visiting again.","11770":"Visited here for the first time and had a nice time.","11771":"Zoo is large with a lot to see and do, we spent a few hours walking round to fit everything in.","11772":"Some animals weren\u2019t out but as it was a cold day in mid February that\u2019s to be expected and it wasn\u2019t a problem as there was still plenty others we got to see.","11773":"It is very hilly so that\u2019s something to be aware of if you aren\u2019t great on your feet.","11774":"We pre booked tickets online which was definitely worth while as we got straight in whereas the line to purchase them was really busy.","11775":"Absolute waste of \u00a354.00 entrance fee and \u00a34.00 for the car park, with a discount!!At least 75% of the displays were empty, got the top of a hill and walked back down only to find all the indoor displays were closed, Penguin March was 2 penguins!1 lion2 zebras1 rhinoDon\u2019t go, worst zoo I have ever visited, didn\u2019t realise animals only work half days or go travelling in February!","11776":"Took my 8 year old son to see the giant lanterns.","11777":"They are all spectacular.","11778":"We were lucky with weather, and went on the last weekend so it wasn\u2019t too busy.","11779":"The other pleasant surprise was that there were not too many food trucks or market stalls around, meaning you could just walk around and enjoy the experience.","11780":"A fantastic family event.","11781":"We took our grandchildren to see the Chinese lanterns, what a fabulous evening we had.","11782":"Once inside the zoo, you pick a time slot when you book your tickets, you just follow the route around the zoo at your own pace and admire the beautiful handmade lanterns in all their glory.","11783":"we stopped to have something to eat thinking we'd seen all the lanterns but were delighted to find we were only half the way round and there were plenty more to see.","11784":"All of us enjoyed this outing and we do hope they will be back next year.","11785":"A memorable evening well worth the money.","11786":"What a magical night.","11787":"The lanterns were truly magical.","11788":"Well done to the creative team.","11789":"Fab atmosphere.","11790":"Great live performance of Chinese Acrobats.","11791":"Thank you.","11792":"All the animals were extremely interesting and the penguins were very funny!","11793":"It was amazing to see pandas and koalas .Overall","11794":"it was worth the money and can spend all day there","11795":"We mainly came to the zoo to look at the pandas and penguins!","11796":"If that\u2019s what you\u2019re going for, you\u2019ll have a great time.","11797":"We were lucky that the pandas were awake and in their indoor area for up close viewing!","11798":"We didn\u2019t have to book a special panda visit but I can imagine in the summer when you get a time slot, it could be hit and miss depending what the pandas are doing!The penguin parade is good fun, the penguins leave their area and walk right by you!The rest of the zoo was pretty basic and hilly to walk around to each attraction.","11799":"We visited the Lantern Show at the zoo which this year had the theme of Myths and Legends.","11800":"This takes place after dark in the evening and if you are expecting to see any of the live animals you will be disappointed.","11801":"However, you can get a reduction to go to the zoo during the day.","11802":"The Lanterns were stunning and although it was a pretty cold evening there was lots to see and everyone that we encountered seemed to be enjoying the experience.","11803":"You could also top up on food and drinks from a range of venues if you wanted to.","11804":"The zoo is hilly, but there was scope for getting round the attraction even if you were disabled.","11805":"We were there about two and half hours and apart from the lanterns there was a strange, but quite interesting little show which involved various kinds of juggling.","11806":"Wish we\u2019d done more research in advance as had we known what to expect we wouldn\u2019t have bothered and would have saved ourselves \u00a3100.","11807":"It definitely should be staggered pricing depending on season considering the money we spent and didn\u2019t see half the animals there or enclosures were closed.","11808":"Lions, pandas, tigers..you name it the big attractions weren\u2019t visible, disappointing after you\u2019ve worked your way to top of a mountain pushing a pram.","11809":"Not easily laid out either so you have to go back on yourself often to see things.","11810":"Had high hopes but won\u2019t return and wouldn\u2019t recommend.","11811":"Chester is 100x better on every level.","11812":"Best thing about this visit was the sweets we bought on the way out, and the penguin enclosure!","11813":"Sadly, this was a disappointing experience.","11814":"A Valentines day out at the zoo turned into a walk around  looking to spot elusive animals.","11815":"Most enclosures were empty with the animals either hiding or sleeping out of site.","11816":"Did manage to see some poor monkeys that looked bored out of their skin repeatedly walking backwards and forwards in their enclosure.","11817":"The penguins were fun but the smell was overwhelming.","11818":"We we not told at admissions that the koalas were closed.","11819":"Didnt see the pandas as they were hiding.","11820":"Think I saw a lion in the distance","11821":"but maybe it was a ginger cat!.","11822":"Overall very disappointing for such a high price at nearly \u00a340 for two.  Would not recommend.","11823":"Left feeling very cheated sadly.","11824":"We love zoo and thought we would try this while in edinburgh.","11825":"It was terrible, the conditions of the animal in each cage was very poor.","11826":"I can see why people wish for zoos to be closed and this is the perfect example.","11827":"Must enclosures had only one or two animals that looked like death would have been a great service to them.","11828":"We did see the monkeys get fed and there was a small bird enclosure which you could feed nectar to the birds.","11829":"This was the only time it was enjoyable.","11830":"Was initially surprised by how seemingly small the zoo was compared to Whipsnade but there is a lot to see and we spent almost the entire day exploring the site.","11831":"It's located on the side of a large hill so be prepared to spend a lot of time walking up and down hill.","11832":"We primarily wanted to see the pandas (which was a joy).","11833":"What was nice was the variety of animals there.","11834":"Also enjoyed how it's laid out and designed.","11835":"For instance, the tiger enclosure features a glass tunnel (like you would see at an aquarium) and the tigers can walk over the top.","11836":"Overall, thoroughly impressed.","11837":"I had seen the signs advertising this for a while and missed it last year so made sure I didn\u2019t this year.","11838":"I went with my Wife and 2 young children.","11839":"We got a groupon which made it \u00a316 each as the kids went free as they are under 2.","11840":"As you would expect the animals are not visible so don\u2019t expect to see them but do not let it ditract from your experience.","11841":"The lanterns look amazing in the dark back drop.","11842":"Some of them move and they have a good theme.","11843":"As the zoo is on a hill it can be a steep walk uphill but don\u2019t worry it\u2019s Down hill at the end.","11844":"They also have a performance to watch half way round.","11845":"There is hot drinks available and also some food huts.","11846":"Would visit again next year","11847":"We bought tickets to see the Chinese Lantern evening display and took advantage of half price daytime tickets.","11848":"Ages since we last visited.","11849":"Delighted to see the Giant Pandas - midday and active, munching through masses of bamboo.","11850":"No booking time required.","11851":"Loved the penguin parade, Budungo trail chimps and all the favourites - lions, tiger, pygmy hippo.","11852":"Quiet for a weekend in February, but all the restaurants were open, fab pizza!The evening lanterns were superb.","11853":"A good mix of informative signs with thought provoking comment.","11854":"Wrap up warm, leave a couple of hours and room for fresh doughnuts","11855":"Went with family including 3 6 and 10 year old.","11856":"Was nice and quiet and was able to spend the whole day without any queues or the like.","11857":"I guess understandably - given the time of year a lot of enclosures were empty or being refurbished.","11858":"Indoor areas for viewing are excellent for the Panda, tigers and monkeys at the research area.","11859":"Penguin area is great and being able to see them so gracefully swimming underwater was fantastic.","11860":"They are not joking about how steep it is and we were really glad we took a push chair for the 3 year old.","11861":"Cute day out for couples.. a lot of walking involved so would take a buggy if going with young children!More suitable for taking children.","11862":"Personally would go earlier in the day to make the most of it, there are different sections which have set times so if you get there earlier you can suss them out without missing out!","11863":"Beautiful, rising groundsBeautiful, rising grounds and lovely place to spend a very nice afternoon outdoors.","11864":"Signage points you to whichever area you wish to visit and on arrival there are plenty of educational displays with relevant information.","11865":"Animals are often difficult to spot which is, in itself, not a bad thing as it gives you the impression that the Edinburgh Zoo cares more about providing wild animals in captivity with environments that are suited for them than catering to a circus show.","11866":"The zoo offers a daily penguin parade for those penguins who  choose to leave their large pool area and go for a circular walk (no one is pushing them to do anything and the staff make a point of taking the opportunity to educate visitors about penguin habits and habitat).","11867":"Wonderfull surroundings, one of the best zoo\u2019s we\u2019ve been to, kids loved it and so did we.","11868":"Cream on the cake are the penguins","11869":"Excellent!","11870":"The pictures do it no justice!!!","11871":"Will definitely be back next year...only gripe is it was maybe a bit pricey at around \u00a350 for four of us including a five and two year old.","11872":"Also didn\u2019t go for food this time after disastrous food experience last time!","11873":"Nice day and we got to see the pandas in action.","11874":"Plenty of attractions and food halls.","11875":"The only downside is the animals are very close together and you could easily do the zoo in a couple of hours","11876":"Fantastic experience with impressive displays of Chinese lanterns walking us through Chinese legends and Scottish Myths and tales.","11877":"The artisan huts with Chinese products were also a welcome surprise; if this event returns, we would 100% recommend to anyone visiting.","11878":"Just love going here as there is plenty to do and see.","11879":"There is also nice areas to eat or have a picnic and staff are very knowledgeable and friendly.","11880":"The penguin March is fun for all seeing them strut there stuff.","11881":"Highly recommended by me as it fabulous family day out.","11882":"Last month I visited Edinburgh Zoo with my friends and it was a great visit.","11883":"I especially liked the penguin parade.","11884":"I didn't expect the big hill inside the zoo but definitely worth it.","11885":"Visited the zoo during my trip to Edinburgh, unfortunately the weather was awful and the high winds meant that some enclosures had to be closed, the staff were extremely helpful and explained all this on arrival and as a result we got a discount on the price.","11886":"I wasn't expecting it to be such a large zoo or to have such a variety of animals.","11887":"The Pandas obviously stole the show and everyone seemed mesmerised by watching them eating.","11888":"The penguins were also a high point and we stayed at listened to the talk and watched them being fed.","11889":"The Chinese lanterns were being set up when we visited,  although we didn't get to see them light up, they were just as lovely in the daytime","11890":"The zoo was good and well worth going to.","11891":"Only downside is that we went with the cold weather, which is not ideal for something outdoors and some of the animals were hard to see because of this.","11892":"Would definitely return but in the summer, the prices were reasonable though and the staff helpful.","11893":"I really wanted to see the giant pandas so we decided to visit.","11894":"Being winter it was pretty quiet","11895":"so was nice to basically have the whole zoo to yourself and not get stuck in the crowds.","11896":"The giant pandas were beautiful if not a bit shy.","11897":"One was asleep and the other sat eating with his back to us!","11898":"I\u2019m not complaining as I would probably do the same if people where staring at me all day.","11899":"Apart from the pandas there was lots to see and the zoo also has a Chinese lantern exhibition on.","11900":"The pretty decorations are dotted around the zoo and are amazing.","11901":"Not all the cafes were open during our visit but as it was quiet it was understandable.","11902":"When you visit make sure you go right up to the top near the tigers, the view from there is incredible.","11903":"Plenty of buses stop outside the zoo and there are also taxis outside if you need one.","11904":"Overall a fantastic day out for all.","11905":"Such a good zoo.","11906":"It is on a hill though which tired us out but apart from that it is the best zoo I\u2019ve been to.","11907":"So many different animals, easy to follow map, information boards are good, everything about the zoo is really good.","11908":"If recommend to anybody.","11909":"Had a lovely day the sun was shining but was a bit chilly.","11910":"I wanted to go to the zoo to see the pandas and wasn't disappointed only managed to see the female the mail was hiding because it was to cold.","11911":"The map was a bit confusing we wanted to see the koala bear but got lost.","11912":"We saw a 4 day old tapir baby it was so tiny and had loads of spots.","11913":"Would recommend the zoo","11914":"but it's on a really big hill.","11915":"Fantastic place to visit for couples and family alike.","11916":"Enjoy the penguin parade daily.","11917":"Make sure you have a full day free to see all of it.","11918":"Took my 2 grandchildren for keeper experience, could not fault it.","11919":"Keeper was excellent, got to feed monkeys ,meerkats, armadillos, penguins and tagu.","11920":"Children said it was one of their best days ever and they got certificate and t shirt to take away, Was expensive but it was worth it.","11921":"I stayed at the Corstophine Rd Holiday Inn and found the zoo was right next door","11922":"so a visit was a must.","11923":"Arrived early enough to avoid the majority of the families for an hour, which as an adult without small children in tow for a change, made the visit more pleasurable.","11924":"The Pandas were sleeping at 11am, but up and eating an hour or so later.","11925":"What a privilege.","11926":"The zoo is on a hill so be prepared for some slopes and steps (always both, but saw some horizontal pushers of wheel & push chairs up the steeper inlclines).","11927":"The ape enclosure with its information on the research, augmented by being able to watch the researchers in action, was excellent.","11928":"Cold, dreary day so many of the animals were indoors and less active but still plenty to see.","11929":"I couldn\u2019t stop for long, but definitely enough to do for several hours, with several optional events as well.","11930":"Augmented by s magnificent display of Chinese lanterns, I\u2019d definitely recommend a visit.","11931":"Although it was a cold January Sunday, the zoo was busy, lots of animals and facts and figures on the animal kingdom and the environment.","11932":"The penguin parade wowed the kids, the zookeepers can't be more helpful or informative.","11933":"Nice coffe break in one of the many cages then onwards to the big cats.","11934":"The only downside it's pretty hilly so you need to be able to walk uphill or have a strong person to push you.","11935":"We visited Edinburgh Zoo as a family last night to see the Giant Lanterns for the first time.","11936":"One word sums it up...WOW!","11937":"There are so many lanterns to see and we really appreciated the talent that goes in to making this wonderful display.","11938":"The colours are vibrant, the Chinese legends and Scottish Myths are well explained and very interesting to read about.","11939":"It was interesting to hear people react to the displays, especially Arthur's Seat!","11940":"Watch out for the group of Haggis running around and make sure to count those legs.","11941":"Some of the lanterns move and this is joyful.","11942":"It takes about an hour and a half to 2 hours to wander round comfortably and see everything.","11943":"We watched the young acrobats on stage too and marvelled at their skills.","11944":"There are a few food outlets open and most people welcomed the hot chocolate on a freezing cold night.","11945":"Parking was easy and only \u00a32 for the Lanterns, which is very good.","11946":"Although it was busy, you never felt crowded at any point.","11947":"The display of endangered and extinct animals makes people think and, although sad, it did let you consider how we can all \"rewrite the ending\".","11948":"Really worth visiting and we will go again next year when the Lantern display changes.","11949":"We had a fantastic time walking round Edinburgh Zoo seeing the lanterns with our 3 year old daughter.","11950":"The detail is incredible and we spent around 2 hours there.","11951":"The show was brilliant.","11952":"I would highly recommend this if wrapped up warm.","11953":"What did put a dampener on things was that we discovered that we could have got in for \u00a34 cheaper per person if buying on Groupon!","11954":"Afternoon tea exclusively for members.","11955":"Sounds wonderful.","11956":"It was awful.","11957":"The cake stand appeared.","11958":"Sandwiches curling at the edges.","11959":"Cakes that were obviously bought at the cheapest possible supplier - nasty after taste of cheap fat.","11960":"A pot of cream was presented.","11961":"When I asked where the scones were I was told there were none but the cream was for the mince pies.","11962":"The mince pies could have been used for construction work.","11963":"The top tier of the cake-stand contained two shop bought cheap and nasty carrot cake cupcakes.","11964":"My coffee was topped up regularly from a flask.","11965":"My friend was presented with a tea bag and she was then regularly offered hot water.","11966":"I wrote to the Zoo to tell them about this awful experience.","11967":"They can't be bothered to reply.","11968":"Went to zoo with family & our grandson , brilliant day , staff are very helpful , plenty of animals to see , spent the whole day there & our grandson loved it .","11969":"Took a packed lunch with us , bought coffee & juice there , seen the penguin parade it was good , the weather was ok , a bit cold but at least it didnt rain \ud83d\ude0a would definitely recommend edinburgh zoo for a day out with the kids \ud83d\ude01\ud83d\udc4c","11970":"We managed to see both Pandas eating and playing which was a highlight.","11971":"There are also many other animals such as the chimpanzees and penguins which we enjoyed among others.","11972":"Overall a great day out.","11973":"A decent zoo.","11974":"We saw penguins, a panda, the koalas...Couldn\u2019t spot the tiger or lion and lots of the enclosures appeared to be empty - I assume animals were hiding because of the weather.","11975":"The zoo was decorated with Chinese lanterns and various other art work which was lovely.","11976":"I couldn\u2019t help but think this was the best part.","11977":"Lots of food outlets closed.","11978":"The playparks were dangerously slippy - obviously rain effects this","11979":"but it was sooo bad and with it being covered in boulders it just seemed like an accident waiting to happen.","11980":"Areas of the Zoo seemed tired.","11981":"Some animal enclosures seemed especially small.","11982":"Zoo is hilly and some areas are quite steep - little legs tired quickly and I hadn\u2019t brought a pushchair.","11983":"Wouldn\u2019t be back in a hurry, have been to much better zoos.","11984":"It seemed very expensive for what it was.","11985":"If you\u2019re going to Edinburgh Zoo this year take plenty of money or a packed lunch ................","11986":"My wife and I took our granddaughter and because the weather wasn\u2019t great we decided to pop in for a cuppa and a bite to eat.............","11987":"that\u2019s when I saw it \ud83d\ude48 a cheese & onion pastie for nearly 6 quid ??????","11988":"Cmon Edinburgh Zoo give us parents and grandparents a chance to enjoy the experience at the zoo.","11989":"I\u2019m more than happy to pay a reasonable price for food but I won\u2019t give you the shirt off my back as well............very disappointed \ud83d\udc4e","11990":"Had a great day out at this zoo.","11991":"One of the most beautiful zoos i have ever been to.","11992":"All the animals so well cared for..very clean and well kept.","11993":"The penguin pool\/ enclosure is beautiful and so accessible for the public to see the animals close up.","11994":"There are 3 eating places in the Zoo..the zoo itself is on a hill so its quite a treck to get to the very top","11995":"but well worth it.","11996":"Would definitely go back.","11997":"Staff were also very friendly at the main entrance and a lovely gift shop as well.","11998":"First time  visit to view Chinese lanterns and Drsgons. .","11999":"Would highly recommend for all ages,.","12000":"Zoo staff very helpful.","12001":"This is the second time the zoo has hosted the chinese lanterns, though a different theme.","12002":"Over 450 breathtaking lanterns, of all shapes and sizes, made with greatest detail in the theme of Myths and Legends. . .","12003":"Absolutely FANTASTIC.","12004":"A stage set up about quarter of the way round, where you see 3 different AMAZING acts.","12005":"Wrap up, take your time to take in the sights and sounds of these magnificent lanterns.","12006":"Three quaters way round 4 or 6 stalls where you can purchase chinese hand painted glass, handcrafted wire ornaments, hand painted pictures etc.","12007":"Food is expensive ie Sausage rolls \u00a31 50 per INCH!!","12008":"REALLY?","12009":"Couldn't believe our eyes seeing this! . . .","12010":"On more positive side the van up beside the mermaids etc (old polar bear enclosure) is the most reasonable priced place there and does the best hot chocolate and freshly made donuts!!!On","12011":"the whole DEFINITELY worth a visit but eat elsewhere!!","12012":"I had not been here for a lot of years, hubby had not been before, we were staying not far from the zoo so decided to visit at New Year...","12013":"it was a bit disappointing for the price you pay for entry... lots of empty cages and enclosures... tried to see the panda","12014":"but she was hiding!","12015":"but we did see the penguins, lions, but best of all was the koala bear with her baby, a lot of steep paths to climb as well, there is a caf\u00e9 on site.","12016":"We visited the zoo during the day which was a great experience in particular the pandas and the penguins and then the lanterns at night.","12017":"Having seen the lanterns during the day I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when they were lit up at night","12018":"but I was not disappointed.","12019":"The story they tell makes you think about the world and the detrimental impact humans are having on some species along with what organisations are doing in an effort to combat this.","12020":"Also if you pre buy your lantern ticket and present it at the desk if you want to visit the zoo during the day then zoo entry is only \u00a310.","12021":"We visited on Saturday, 29th December, 2018.","12022":"Entry prices are about normal, for this type of venue.","12023":"As we are part of the older generation, we were offered transport to the top of the zoo.","12024":"This was very welcome as the site is quite steep.","12025":"We were driven, in a car adapted to take wheelchairs, by a gentleman of similar age to us.","12026":"He took a leisurely drive to the top of the site, with several stops to tell us about the exhibits, and the zoo.","12027":"He new his subject very well.","12028":"He gave us his mobile number in case we needed another ride.","12029":"The zoo is well laid out and well signposted.","12030":"It is easy to zig zag down the hill, visiting the various compounds.","12031":"The chimpanzee facility is spectacular.","12032":"It is a research, and educational centre.","12033":"The penguin pool is a must see.","12034":"Various events take place throughout the day, so check out the timetable.","12035":"Toilet facilities are good, plenty of them.","12036":"Likewise there is a good choice of places to eat, or just get a cuppa.","12037":"A shop is situated in the entrance\/exit building for your mementos.","12038":"The zoo is on the main road from Edinburgh to the airport, so it has a good bus service to, and from, Edinburgh, frequent and a, fairly, short ride.","12039":"Very good zoo, with a bit of a up hill trekI was impressed with the Monkeys and I love the fact it's investing in expansion projects for an even bigger better future","12040":"We were so excited to visit this zoo, some of the animals were hard to see which I understand as it was winter so I wasn't expecting them all to be out, but I was so upset when I saw the tiger which was pacing constantly around his enclosure and you could see he was very stressed, his enclosure needed to be far bigger and they need a lot of enrichment if there to be kept in zoos.","12041":"Also the lion was pacing in front of the window as well, it was just awful to see and I won't be visiting zoos again as I feel especially lion and tigers should not be kept there.","12042":"Thoroughly enjoyed our afternoon at the zoo, especially the penguin parade!","12043":"The penguin talk was informative, and seeing the lanterns dotted sound the park added a really nice and interesting touch.","12044":"We have been there to see this beautiful yearly event at the Edinburgh Zoo.","12045":"Everything is well organised,  t his is a Chinese cultural events, loads of beautiful lanterns enlightened in the night, beautiful view, connect with myths and legends of Scotland and China.","12046":"Absolutely gorgeous.","12047":"Big car park,  2\u00a3.","12048":"It deserves to be seen.","12049":"Fantastic, what a a show hope it is on again, not cheap but Groupon etc do good deals,Worth every penny","12050":"The animals at this zoo are not in appropriate weather conditions and were visibly huddling together to stay warm whilst shivering.","12051":"The only animals that were enjoying the snowy temperatures were the penguins.","12052":"The enclosures are not big enough for the tigers, lions etc so on a whole this is probably one of the worst zoos I\u2019ve been to in regard to animal care.","12053":"Zoo is very poor and getting run down.","12054":"On our last visit we had a terrible experience with the staff \/ supervisor and will not be going back.","12055":"Customer service is appalling.","12056":"Ourselves and the other family we were with have been members for many years but will not be renewing our membership ever again after this.","12057":"We will spend our money elsewhere and actually get value for money rather than being ripped off.","12058":"Came to Edinburgh to see the pandas I would recommend going 1st thing in the morning because they're not always out- we were lucky we got to see them but many were not so lucky.","12059":"The faciloties are OK however the food courts were not all open.","12060":"The toilets were clean through out and staff very friendly.","12061":"Buy tickets online much cheaper than on the door","12062":"Travelled 250 miles in the car (5 hours and 30 mins) to have a night away in Edinburgh, and of course you have to do something for the next day, and as we\u2019re animals lovers and seen the best zoo\u2019s in the world we thought we\u2019d give this a go as we\u2019ve never actually seen a panda or koala!Wasn\u2019t that a mistake, can\u2019t blame the zoo as it was January and it was very cold but the panda was fast asleep and couldn\u2019t see it and the koala was high up in the tree and only seen its foot, very disappointing.","12063":"The zoo itself is quite large itself but had a lot of tat dotted all over it and everywhere and never seen anything like it, awful.","12064":"The animals themselves, the lion was kept in a small room pacing back and forwards and wasn\u2019t in its outside enclosure which was disappointing and the same with the tiger.","12065":"Everything felt so far away from what I\u2019ve experienced in the past and regret saying I would not return.","12066":"There are so many animals to see at the zoo.","12067":"Seeing Koalas is amazing and they even have a baby one.","12068":"The sun bears were very active.","12069":"The zoo is very hilly so hard going.","12070":"I would also advise wrapping up warm.","12071":"The zoo isn\u2019t cheap but there is a lot to do.","12072":"The staff are very helpful.","12073":"The food in the Grassland restaurant was very good and very quick and had lots of gluten free options.","12074":"You can rent lockers at reception to put bags in, \u00a32 for a small one and \u00a34 for a large one.","12075":"The zoo has short opening times 10-4 at the moment with most animal houses closing at 3.30 so I would recommend getting there early.","12076":"The penguin parade is small as they don\u2019t force the penguins but I would rather that.","12077":"The myths and legends things are really good.","12078":"The animals are well looked after and have lots of space.","12079":"Toilets even have heating.","12080":"Would recommend visiting the zoo,however a point to improve on would be to have more benches particularly in some of the animal houses such as the monkeys and the koalas so that you can rest tired feet or sit and watch the animals.","12081":"We went to the zoo just to see the pandas !","12082":"We were very lucky to actually see one the other we didn't get to see !","12083":"The pandas have a sleeping area which is hidden away from view so it is purely by chance if you get to see them at all ...","12084":"I imagine there were some very disappointed people the day we went.","12085":"The zoo is lovely and clean and all the animals are obviously well looked after.","12086":"It was very cold the day we went and most of the animals were inside asleep.","12087":"Absolutely thoroughly enjoyed the mythical legends event that they currently have running at Edinburgh Zoo.","12088":"Just amazing, great for the whole family, they had entertainment half way through the evening and again thoroughly enjoyable.","12089":"A must see and definitely not to be missed especially if it's a first in Edinburgh.","12090":"Tickets are reasonable and can be booked a number of ways online and at the desk on arrivel.","12091":"Really enjoyable day out.","12092":"Well worth a visit.","12093":"Good variety of animals including the Pandas, lovely sun bear and penguins.","12094":"Staff very informative.","12095":"Gift shop not over priced.","12096":"It is always fun to go to a zoo but more so if you know the animals are happy.","12097":"The enclosures at Edinburgh are large and suited to the animals.","12098":"The breeding programs and campaigns they have in place are impressive and it is always an honour to see china\u2019s panda\u2019s, the only ones in the uk!","12099":"Boyfriend took me for a magical bday treat to visit the pandas and to see the giant chinese lanterns .What","12100":"a fantastic weekend","12101":"Decided to take my daughter along to Edinburgh Zoo for a day out to give my wife some peace in the last weekend of the Christmas holidays.","12102":"First advice is to plan and book ahead as you can make a little saving on admission prices, as while the price for kids is actually really reasonable, price for adults is a bit steep, and for one adult and a 5 year old, you are talking almost \u00a340, so it\u2019s not exactly a cheap day out.","12103":"The day we had out was really enjoyable, but a number of the animals were asleep or hiding, but we saw enough to make it worthwhile (my daughter loved the anteater, zebra and penguins) and we spent a good 4 hours walking around.","12104":"Plenty of picnic spots, so worth while bringing a packed lunch to eat.","12105":"Also would recommend going to see the penguins parade with low expectations, as it\u2019s hardly a large crowd of them walking, as it was just two who went out for a stroll.","12106":"Also be prepared to be pushed and shoved to see the pandas.","12107":"All in all most satisfied day out and will be back with my other daughter when she is older.","12108":"We managed to get discounted tickets online, glad we did as half the animals were missing.","12109":"No or limited shows, which left us feeling a bit cheated.","12110":"Overall though, it was a great experience that we both enjoyed.","12111":"The Chinese New Year exhibit was great but would have been even better lit up.","12112":"One of the better zoos I have visited and would recommend in warmer climates.","12113":"During our stay in Edinburgh me and my partner went to The Edinburgh Zoo, I was so excited to see the penguins and take part in the penguin walk \ud83d\ude01We arrived early so we could spend the majority of the day at the zoo...","12114":"And we did.","12115":"The zoo has a shuttle cart thing that takes passengers up the hill and back down, but, due to the weather on the day we went the shuttle was not on soooo we walked till our feet were like rocks.","12116":"We seen the pandas, chimps, birds of prey and finally we turned up at the penguins....","12117":"I was sooo excited to see them.","12118":"The peguins were just...","12119":"Being penguins.","12120":"The keepers opened the gates and asked all visitors to create like a human barrier to stop them running off...","12121":"The keepers did advise that the penguins will come out at thier own accord, and the keepers won't entice or force them out....","12122":"On this occasion the penguins didn't come out...","12123":"GuttedLeft disappointed but understanding, gift shop was reasonably priced, picked up a penguin key ring to remember, can't wait to return.","12124":"We went hoping to catch a glimpse of a Panda, along with every single person who went on the day we did and with many others we were disappointed.","12125":"Not a single sight despite all the signs and various viewing angles, bit of a con!","12126":"I would not have minded if I just saw one sleeping!","12127":"The lions were sleeping, a Tiger was pacing up and down, monkeys, penguins and birds were about but on the whole very under whelmed by it all.","12128":"Not sure if it is any better in the summer!","12129":"The pandas and the monkeys were our favourite.","12130":"The zoo is very hilly but apart from that its a nice place and a good day out.","12131":"The resturant and the cafe were also nice and all the staff were very friendly and happy to help.","12132":"Pre book online a day before and get 10% off.","12133":"Best zoo I have visited in a while & I bet it gets pretty busy during the summer!","12134":"We visited on New Years day and the walk alone certainly blew away the cobwebs\ud83d\ude00  I would recommend wearing comfy walking shoes as many of the enclosures are up steep walkways.","12135":"We were lucky to see the pandas (lazy bears can sleep up to 16 hours a day).","12136":"The cafes that were open even catered for my diary intolerance with soy milk which was great as it was a cold day so lattes were very much needed.","12137":"Considering it was winter we spent a good 3 hours walking round & thoroughly enjoyed our visit.","12138":"My partner took me here for my Birthday as I'm a huge panda fan and I've always wanted to see one we waited around most of the day as Panda viewing wasn't guaranteed but we where lucky enough to see them an my was it worth the wait.","12139":"Not only where the Pandas amazing, but all the staff where very knowledgeable and there are some fantastic animals to be seen!We also got to go during the lanterns which was absolutely beautiful especially all lit up!I'd 100% recommend this zoo, we stayed for 6 and a half hours and didn't get bored there's tonnes to see, and a great cafe and restaurant on sight too!","12140":"The only Zoo in the U.K. where you can see Pandas.","12141":"We had to pay arguably the best Zoo from my childhood a visit, for my daughter to share the joy I felt in the penguins walk.","12142":"The keepers are all knowledgeable, friendly and approachable.","12143":"They volunteer information that elevated our experience for their input.","12144":"They very clearly respect the needs and wellbeing of the animals and it shows in the behaviour of the animals.","12145":"Great experience.","12146":"A good leg workout too!","12147":"We were overjoyed to get a glimpse of the tiny new lemur arrival.","12148":"Wish we could return in spring to see the Joey when it\u2019s ready to emerge from Mums pouch.","12149":"Really Great Zoo.","12150":"Nice half a day trip with time for a spot of sightseeing in the same day, legs permitting!","12151":"\u00a320 a pop to see very little animal life in winter, is a big ask.","12152":"There was an extensive display of massive Chinese fantasy animals, but sadly real red pandas - no show.","12153":"Lemur walk-through - no show, Scottish wild cats, on safari somewhere in the Highlands, zebra and antelope invisible.","12154":"Painted dogs - no show, sun bears - no show.","12155":"Tiger and lion asleep.","12156":"In the Monkey House punters scurried from one window to another trying to spot the lucky monkey with the raffle ticket who gets to pop down and swing for five seconds before disappearing up the hatch to hand the ticket to another monkey.","12157":"The game is to make the punters run up and down as fast as they do!","12158":"Probably serves us right.","12159":"The best zoo-value is in the meerkats and pelicans near the entrance, and the penguin enclosure.","12160":"Other bird displays were rather dank and depressing, although the parakeets were chirpy.","12161":"Fortunately The Grasslands (Tennesee, going to Grasslands, Grasslands...)","12162":"Restaurant does nice food at a good price.","12163":"It was a triumph when the previously hiding black and white panda came out briefly -  after our lunch, and it's lunch, to poo in our faces.","12164":"But I'm not really surprised the Panda propagation programme has so far been unsuccessful, it is a bit  of a grim environment for any kind of procreation.","12165":"Herds of small children had fun running about in a safe space, and watching them was a good deal more entertaining than watching the other mostly sluggish or hidden wildlife.","12166":"No doubt the chilly weather made many of the animals reluctant to emerge.","12167":"My point is, there should be a  discount for winter visitors, because there is so very little to see in.","12168":"Certainly wouldn't advise going with older kids who will expect live, not plastic animal appearances, and are no longer entertained by playing peekaboo amongst the fantasy plastic dragons, fairies and unicorns.","12169":"( Wish they'd been lit up since the day was dull, that would have cheered us up, been value for money.)Be warned, the site is very hilly and my motorised buggy struggled up slippy surfaces.","12170":"But it is picturesque, and no doubt on a sunny day we would have had spectacular views.","12171":"Sadly, after 4 hours of playing hide and seek with the living residents, we left before lighting up time.","12172":"In fact the  zoo closes at 4pm and you have to re-enter and pay a further \u00a320  to see the Chinese animals lit up.","12173":"Words fail me.","12174":"I know zoos are strapped for cash, but we felt under-informed and therefore over-fleeced.","12175":"It would have been appreciated if winter visitors had been advised that half the inmates visible during summer months would be unavailable for viewing at this time of year.","12176":"Just a thought....","12177":"A half day zoo keeper experience for my mum's 80th seemed a risky choice.","12178":"Quite pricey and would she get value for money?","12179":"The answer is a definite yes!","12180":"She had a smashing three hours in the company of eight different animals.","12181":"The keeper she was with was very friendly and knowledgeable, and really patient with mum's never-ending stream of questions!","12182":"Me and my teenage son were allowed to join them to feed the chimps and got close up to the penguins as she fed them.","12183":"She came away with a certificate and T-shirt, and bubbling with excitement from a really special day.","12184":"We've been before several times.","12185":"We went during the day to see the animals before going to the lantern event in the evening.","12186":"The lantern event was just beyond words and truly magical!","12187":"The kids and us enjoyed it immensely!","12188":"Ok bought tickets for Chinese lanternsLiked the look of itI'm disabled  in a wheelchairSo it's very hilly just to hard to push a wheelchair round itWas in for about 15 minHad to turn backNot very wheelchair friendlySaid to girl at tillAs I handed my tokens back for marshmallows and a drink could not get round far enough to get itWas very disappointedWas not offered any kind of refund after paying 44 poundsWas really.upset not being able to.get round itA silvestro","12189":"Edinburgh zoo is a good day out but when revisiting as an adult I realise how small some of the enclosures are.","12190":"Especially the poor rhino on his own in a very small enclosure.","12191":"There is quite a lot to see","12192":"but I think it needs updating and modernised as it hasn\u2019t changed in years!","12193":"Pretty expensive too.","12194":"I prefer the safari park as it offers more and has better enclosures for the animals to roam free.","12195":"We went to Edinburgh Zoo as part of a weekend trip to Edinburgh in general.","12196":"Our grandchildren were with us and had been very excited about seeing the Giant Pandas and the Koala bears in particular.","12197":"We were not disappointed on either count and got to see the Giant Panda up close and the Koalas were wake but the Koala Country closed very shortly after our early visit so we were pleased we made them an early priority on our day out.","12198":"The Zoo has good large enclosures for the animals and makes every effort to educate about the fragility of some of the environments that threaten the long term existence of many species in our world.we all enjoyed our visit and would recommend putting it on your itinerary when in beautiful Edinburgh","12199":"We went just before New Year and the place wasn't busy at all which meant plenty of space to view the animals and enjoy ourselves.","12200":"They were kept in clean enclosures and I felt they were well cared for.","12201":"Please visit as this all helps with animal conservation.","12202":"I've never known a zoo to have as many little bits and pieces on as Edinburgh Zoo had on when we were there.","12203":"We were there during half-term, so maybe that impacted it, but it was also mid-winter, and quite a nasty day to be at the zoo.","12204":"The show still went on, including all the talks, feedings (although they do these as naturally as possible to mimic non-captive life) and displays were still available.","12205":"Keepers were informative and wanted to share their information with the passers-by - and the animals had SO MUCH ROOM!","12206":"I was happy that their enclosures were so large - even if it does mean you have to search a little longer to find the animals hiding in their terrains!We were a group of 5 able-bodied people, and the zoo is VERY steep, but there are accessible options for those who need it (including your friend who just can't do it anymore), and the food options on-site were generally quite good.","12207":"If packing for a family, a pre-packed lunch is probably easier as there are playgrounds and picnic areas scattered all around.","12208":"All in all, an enjoyable day, although if I weren't a student, it might have been out of budget for all of us to go!","12209":"We were impressed with the Lantern display which was much larger than we had expected.","12210":"The zoo was busy with many families with small children visiting.","12211":"I think the Zoo missed a trick by not opening any of its cafes for this show as it was a chilly Edinburgh and the only catering available was from foot trucks.","12212":"As part of event there was a performance by Chinese performers which we found to be rather dull and boring.","12213":"A lovely zoo with some lovely spaces.","12214":"Was very crowded in the obvious place the panda enclosure and the day was slightly tainted by ignorant visitors who thought it was ok to push me out of the way because she wanted to photograph the panda and people who think it\u2019s ok to push their children to the front of each queue despite everyone being fee paying visitors.","12215":"The tiger and rhino were particularly impressive and the tiny baby baboons were too cute.","12216":"The gift shop was exceedingly expensive","12217":"Thoroughly enjoyed our visit on New Years day where we finally got to see a panda.","12218":"A perfect afternoon...","12219":"Visited today.","12220":"Prepaid online and got quick entry as standard.","12221":"However, how this place calls it self a zoo baffles me!?","12222":"There are barely any animals!!Seriously, I'm not exaggerating when I say that.","12223":"The Pandas didn't appear and stayed hidden from view in their pen for 4 hours, the Lions were invisible, there was empty enclosure after empty enclosure!","12224":"Maybe 60\/40 in terms of occupied and empty.","12225":"There was ONE Tiger, ONE Rhino, ONE Bear.","12226":"Out of maybe a dozen monkey enclosures we saw 2 Baboons, 2 Gibbons and 2 little monkees.","12227":"We saw 2 Zebras from about 100yds away.","12228":"We did see Flamingos, some cow type animals, some chimpanzees which were in their indoor enclosure and seemed very sad.","12229":"We saw Penguins, which were deffo one of the highlights.","12230":"The zoo itself is situated on a steep hillside and we were shattered after the visit.","12231":"It really was quite a physical day.","12232":"I don't understand why most of the animals we saw were by themselves?","12233":"That can't be good for them?","12234":"The bear was pacing up and down a log and seemed stressed.","12235":"The Tapir sat there by itself.","12236":"The Rhino didn't really seem happy.","12237":"It was a bit upsetting and concerning to see them alone like this.","12238":"There is deffo room to increase population and probably happiness but I assume this us down to cost.","12239":"The reptile house displayed a yellow frog, a blue frog, a pancake tortoise, a tarantula, a lizard.....","12240":"that was it!","12241":"Small, cramped and singular......no snakes, no bats or other types of frogs\/dragons etc.","12242":"No Elephants, no Girraffes, no crocodiles, no wolves, hyenas, I could go on and on....","12243":"The biggest shame from all of this though is that IT COULD be brilliant, IT COULD be successful, IT COULD be a triumph.","12244":"But after our visit it looks like it COULD be hanging on to what is a very poor venue.","12245":"We were last at Edinburgh Zoo 4 years ago and at that time I was bitterly disappointed because I felt it was old and tired although very expensive to get in.","12246":"This time, however, my daughter asked to go for her 6th birthday 04\/01\/19.","12247":"It was SO much better.","12248":"In the past few years there have been an abundance of enclosure upgrades of not, complete rebuilds.","12249":"I was pleased to see the hill where the tigers used to be (concrete tiny enclosures) have been completely removed and the big cats have much better living space.","12250":"The general appearance of the zoo space is MUCH better too","12251":"so it was a pleasure to stroll around even in cold January.","12252":"Plenty of healthy happy looking animals and we all enjoyed the informative talks about the insects and penguins.","12253":"We loved you can walk through a few enclosures too like ghe lemurs and the wallaby\u2019s.","12254":"Feeding the parakeets was great too.","12255":"Yes it\u2019s still very expensive","12256":"but I don\u2019t mind so much since the money is clearly going to the right place.","12257":"Well done Edinburgh Zoo.","12258":"We thoroughly enjoyed our day out.","12259":"We visited in January (cold) which meant that most of the animals were not on display.","12260":"Very disappointing but understandable.","12261":"Just wish it was advised before we paid for tickets.","12262":"Save your visit for warmer months.","12263":"It was sadly a disappointing visit to Edinburgh Zoo.","12264":"We attended during the run-up to Christmas and paid the full price for three adults, but we saw hardly any animals.","12265":"Maybe it was too cold, but we walked the entire park and even the zebras and llamas were far away in their fields, we could hardly see them.","12266":"The pandas didn't fancy coming out on that particular day - we went back several times to their enclosure during our visit and they weren't there.","12267":"Felt a bit cheated after paying all that money.","12268":"A really good zoo with lots of interactive activities like 'walk-throughs and Lorikeet feeding with little tubs of nectar!","12269":"The penguin parade was something different too!","12270":"Highlight though was the panda!","12271":"Very active and almost looked like he was posing for pictures!!We went back at night for the Chinese lanterns which were also excellent!Tips:Get wrapped up if visiting in Winter!Save money on the night visit if visotong in day too!Looks like there were lots of offers on 'Groupon!","12272":"Visited the lantern exhibition on the evening of New Year's Day, reluctantly accompanied by my husband.","12273":"We were both utterly enchanted!","12274":"The craftsmanship of the lanterns is stunning and the trail with its wee explanations of each exhibit very well laid out.","12275":"The acrobat performance is also staggeringly impressive!","12276":"I am a keen photographer of wildlife and this zoo does not disappoint.","12277":"One of the few places you can see a Panda and Asian Lions.","12278":"All the animals seem to be well looked after and have good environments.","12279":"Entrance with gift did is just under \u00a320 and \u00a34 to park your car.","12280":"One downside is the zoo is on a big hill.","12281":"For younger fit people it is not a problem, but older and disabled this place could be hard work.","12282":"I saw many Dad\u2019s and","12283":"Mum\u2019s finding the push chair very hard work.","12284":"It was easy to miss some animals and sometimes curiously set out.","12285":"Some animals did not have access due to parts being closed and the zoo felt dated and tired in places.","12286":"Even though some areas were salted we found many slippery surfaces due to a cold night before and 1 degree temp on the day.","12287":"Being on a hill I felt this could of been a hazard for some.","12288":"Having said all that I preferred it over most zoos I have been to this year.","12289":"We took our 2 17yr old sons here as we haven't been for a long time.","12290":"There has been lots of changes some good some not so good.","12291":"Parking is \u00a34 which is fine and zoo entry tickets can be bought on-line a bit cheaper.","12292":"The otters are no longer there or the giraffe's but, the animals on show are fabulous.","12293":"The pandas are a must see although it does get busy in the house.","12294":"Be prepared to climb if you want to visit the lions and tigers as they are at the top of the hill but well worth it.","12295":"The map you're given on entry is ok","12296":"but you can download the app to your phone.","12297":"Would come back again.","12298":"we went to the zoo on new years eve and we also did the latern visit the night before and both visits were excellent!!","12299":"It was nice to see Velu the baby chimp being his usual mischevious self.","12300":"The female Koala bear has a baby in her pouch you can see moving if you look close enough!!","12301":"We had a fantastic time with these awesome animals and freindly well educated staff.","12302":"Be prepared for lots of steep paths !","12303":"Fantastic animals and walkthrough with information on the level of endangering of each species ,how we can help them to conserve life on Earth .","12304":"The animals are clearly well cared for.","12305":"Highlights were the lively baboons, the tiger carrying and eating meat and the pandas of course!","12306":"Spent a wonderful few hours at the Edinburgh Zoo Chinese lantern and light feature.","12307":"Brilliant.","12308":"Well laid out.","12309":"Well organised.","12310":"The acrobatics were a great bonus.","12311":"Adults and children all loved it.","12312":"We had a great time seeing all the animals and reading all the information about them.","12313":"We also came back for the lantern festival which was beautiful.","12314":"Visited the giant lanterns of China at Edinburgh Zoo last night.","12315":"Amazing colours and story.","12316":"Wonderful laid out trail with stunning colours and tales.","12317":"Takes about 90 minutes to see everything.","12318":"Artisan village with lovely handmade gifts.","12319":"Good hot chocolate and smores completed the experience.","12320":"Highly recommended for all ages.","12321":"We went to the zoo today and really enjoyed it the pandas were so adorable and the chimpanzees were lovely the baboons had very young babies and they were both cuddling the baby to keep it warm if you want to stay fit,it\u2019s the zoo for you as there\u2019s quite a few hills walking around it,it also is \u00a34 to park in the zoo car park we loved the penguins too.","12322":"We went for my daughters birthday mainly to see the pandas.","12323":"We were quite aware we may not see them.","12324":"Lady at ticket desk extremely helpful and knowledgeable.","12325":"Went straight to pandas and werent disappointed.","12326":"Amazing animals and we had tears in our eyes watching them.","12327":"Penguins have a huge enclosure.","12328":"Zoo is on a steep incline so bear this in mind.","12329":"Used grasslands restaurant and our waitress Heather was extremely helpful.","12330":"All in all a great day out!!","12331":"It was a rainy, windy day when I visited there, so animals were understandably inside, and didn't see many of them at all.","12332":"I bought a ticket in advance (\u00a317.50), otherwise it would have been \u00a319.50.","12333":"Parking costs \u00a34, and coffee shops and restaurant are pretty expensive as well.","12334":"Highlight is probably penguins, you can see them very close and can watch through a glass wall when they are swimming.","12335":"Lovely day today visiting the zoo, amazing to spend last day here amazing to see all the animals with walkthrough features and talks about different species!","12336":"Staff were polite and helpful nothing was and issue will definitely going back in summer when it\u2019s a bit warmer","12337":"Of course it's December and of course it's cold!","12338":"Many of the animals were in their inside shelters but you can still see them!","12339":"We walked around every enclosure and still got a good view and after being to the zoo a few years ago and then again today they have made lots of improvements!","12340":"There is a guy with long hair and a beard going exhibits around various parts of the zoo and he was fantastic!","12341":"Definitely a place we will go again especially in the summer.","12342":"Visited the Chinese Lanterns with my son and husband tonight as a wee Christmas trip.","12343":"Bought tickets through Itison which gave us entry and marshmallows and a hot drink.","12344":"Awesome event and experience.","12345":"Loved it.","12346":"It was so special","12347":"Great zoo which we have visited on each trip to Edinburgh.","12348":"Love the cafe overlooking the penguin enclosure, great to have a drink\/lunch and watch them through the large window.","12349":"Some new play areas have been added since our last trip, just near the sun bears.","12350":"My two loved these (6&2) and could have stayed their even longer!","12351":"We were very lucky with the giant panda and saw her wandering and eating.","12352":"We don't generally stick around and check much out when at zoos or museum's but we had to stop and watch the pandas do nothing for quite a while.","12353":"This is a fabulous Zoo with a great variety of animals & reptiles & birds to see.","12354":"There is a lovely restaurant.","12355":"The only fault is there are a lot of hills and some are steep.","12356":"I had a lovely day with my 2 grandsons 9 & 11.","12357":"Unfortunately the Pandas did not appear that day.","12358":"A lovely day out at the zoo, our first visit.","12359":"A good array of animals, particularly monkeys - lots of them!","12360":"The zoo wasn\u2019t busy so it was easy to navigate even though there seemed to be a lot of hills!","12361":"Enjoyed the penguin enclosure lots and got a glimpse of feeding time.","12362":"We were told previously to our visit that the pandas weren\u2019t always out for viewing.","12363":"We popped in three times throughout the day to try and see them and felt very lucky to see them on our third visit to their enclosure (around 2.30pm - feeding time!)","12364":"it was definitely worth it!","12365":"Attended as a family group of six adults on a cold starry Friday night and had a ball.","12366":"Lanterns were much more intricate and inventive than last year, take your time and walk around a couple of times and enjoy the experience.","12367":"Well worth the entrance fee,","12368":"I've visited the Zoo just for the Great Lanterns of China after seeing some adverts for this event.","12369":"It wasn't cheap (about GBP 19,00) but absolutely worth it.","12370":"The Artists who made these lanterns are masters of their craft.","12371":"And in addition there were artists performing on a stage thinks like juggling,riding a monocycle etc,which was a pleasure to watch.","12372":"Food and drinks could be bought at several spots,and there were craft stalls which sold paintings,hand carved figures etc.All in all a very entertaining experience.","12373":"Addition: The event is still on until February,17th,2019.","12374":"It's very cold and slightly disappointing visiting the Zoo in the Winter.","12375":"If you do then make sure you wrap up nice and warm as the wind is biting up on Corstorphine Hill.","12376":"We found it to be very quiet and hence most of the quiosks were closed and even the members gate was closed when we visited.","12377":"Many of the animals are not too keen to be outside either.","12378":"Penguins however revel in it and they are the best exhibit by far.","12379":"Pandas too make it worth while","12380":"but if you're not a member then it's an expensive attraction.","12381":"The zoo is unlike any zoo in America.","12382":"While it's very cold right now it was still worth the trip.","12383":"The animals are inside of their indoor keeps but the enclosures alone are well built and the whole place is very well thought out.","12384":"Right now they have lanterns out that light up at night on weekends only.","12385":"GO!","12386":"They look beautiful!","12387":"We were unfortunately there on a weekend and couldn't see them lit up but I can only imagine how much better they are at night!","12388":"The penguin exhibit is amazing, I've never seen one like it.","12389":"At 215 every day they have a penguin walk by the exhibit.","12390":"Make sure you don't miss it!","12391":"Adorable!","12392":"There's a lemur walk through where you actually go INSIDE OF THE ENCLOSURE!","12393":"We visited the zoo in December.","12394":"Not a good time as most of the animals were not to be seen.","12395":"We searched high and low for the lions but did not see them.","12396":"The tigers more than made up for it.","12397":"You can get really close to them.","12398":"It is incredibly hilly.","12399":"We were pushing a pram which did not help.","12400":"I thought it was overpriced.","12401":"I have been to other zoos (Chester) at similar times of year and they are better value.","12402":"The grasslands cafe was good and the food came quickly and was great value.","12403":"edinburgh zoo is a must if visiting edinburgh .","12404":"plenty to see and do and eat ,animals are kept in really good cages with plenty of room etc","12405":"I had a fantastic time here!","12406":"I bought my ticket online to save a couple of pounds and was pleased to see that there was an entrance for those who had prebought tickets.","12407":"The staff were helpful and polite and I was given information for everything I may need from when I entered.","12408":"Just as is specified on the website, it is a long walk and there are paths that can be quite steep so good footwear is a must but if you have mobility issues you are asked as you walk in the front entrance and some help is organised.","12409":"Great variety of animals and enclosures.","12410":"I particularly liked the idea of the penguin parade, unfortunately they chose not to come out on that day","12411":"but I think that it is fair they are given a choice.","12412":"This is a must for a great day out!","12413":"Visited on Sunday evening we arrived early and got straight in.","12414":"Just brilliant one tip though take as many photos as you can then walk round again you will miss things Plenty of food outlets to choose from.","12415":"The trip was worth it.","12416":"We visited with friends on Sunday evening to take in the spectacle of the giant lanterns, we arrived early & were given immediate access which prevented large crowds from forming & facilitated an easier walk around.","12417":"The lanterns were spectacular over 200 of them from Chinese to Myths & Legends to local species & some depicting the demise & extinction of some of our amazing animals such as the dodo & the mammoth, due to climate changes many other are endangered such polar bears & sun bears, poignant & so well organised with over 80,000 led lights, even a selfie station that sent you an image as a reminder of the evening.","12418":"Managed a brief sighting of the chimps in the glass housing but other than that no sight of any other animals.","12419":"The performance appeared a bit slow to start but the spinning of the large vase by the young Chinese girl with her feet was incredibly impressive.","12420":"If you\u2019re in any doubt, don\u2019t be, suited to all ages & great value for money.","12421":"We paid entry into the zoo twice just to see the famous pandas!","12422":"On both occasions we were told they were out only to find they weren\u2019t out.","12423":"The first experience most the zoo was empty!","12424":"Barely anything there.","12425":"Most enclosures were empty.","12426":"Very disappointing experience I must say.","12427":"After being assured the second time we would see the pandas we paid full price entry to again not see anything but empty enclosures.","12428":"Staff were unhelpful and rude.","12429":"Extremely disappointing trips.","12430":"Took the kids.","12431":"Great place","12432":"but...","12433":"Lacking a decent place to grab lunch.","12434":"Found ourselves wishing we had packed a picnic.","12435":"Mums beware.","12436":"The only place in the whole of the UK that has koala bears!!","12437":"Yikes!","12438":"So exciting.","12439":"I had always waited for a chance to come face to face with a real koala and finally I did at Edinburgh zoo.","12440":"The zoo is actually very big and has a very good selection of animals.","12441":"From Lions to tigers, reptiles to birds, a must go visit for any animal lover and to be fair it\u2019s only a short bus ride from the actual town centre","12442":"Prop to this visit, I had last visited the Edinburgh Zoo in 2003, with my niece who is now 18!This time round, I took my 14-months old nephew Sebastian, and he had a great time.","12443":"Shame his parents and I were watching our pennies and struggled to navigate the uphill terrain.","12444":"It\u2019s definitely suits younger persons.","12445":"I recall having an all round great time in 2003.","12446":"However, since then, the Edinburgh Zoo seems to have gone through cut throat transformation that\u2019s spawned a Disney style children\u2019s amusement park.","12447":"Whilst everything now has a price, it wasn\u2019t clear to me that the staff truly the value of the experience that their customers expect.","12448":"This of course is not universal, as some of the staff were extremely professional, helpful and friendly.","12449":"Unfortunately, I shall not be rushing back.","12450":"Indeed, I shall be studying the costs carefully before I return.","12451":"There are other option in Scotland that are now in coming in play.","12452":"I had very high expectations of this zoo, sadly it isn't anywhere near as good as others that I have visited.","12453":"The Zoo has a huge amount of empty cages, and is a maze of random enclosures.","12454":"It is very easy to walk straight past exhibits, the zoo needs a lot more signage.","12455":"Also very disappointed with the lack of animal information, I personally love knowing the animals names.","12456":"It seemed as though the zoo has picked it's \"favourite\" animals and spent all of the money on them.","12457":"With that in mind the chimpanzee house was brilliant as was the Koala house and penguin exhibit.","12458":"The rest of the animals looked quite sad in old worn cages.","12459":"Absolute highlight of the day has to be the pandas they were a saving grace to our trip! ...","12460":"maybe a good idea to reduce your prices in winter as it was freezing, empty and hardly any animals to actually see.","12461":"We went there with children they were very excited to go to zoo.","12462":"we got back home depressed and disappointed.","12463":"animals are not kept in right environment they all looked miserable and cold.","12464":"kids were crying looking at sad, cold meerkats.","12465":"That's not what we should be showing our kids!","12466":"think twice before you go there, to show this lack of compassion!","12467":"Lovely staff put a special birthday message on the entrance sign for our daughter!","12468":"Friendly and approachable.","12469":"The zoo is nice with some entertaining g moment like the feeds and the penguin parade, but I found the I formation on the animals limited even after scanning the bar codes which only take you back to the zoo website .","12470":"I feel it could bring a lot more I formative without major alteration.","12471":"Edinburgh Zoo is situated between the airport and city centre.","12472":"\u201eWe\u2018re on a steep hill!","12473":"\u201c we were warned while buying our tickets and were offered a mobility service, which we declined.","12474":"If you are in any way impaired, you would do well to accept this offer, though.","12475":"It is a steep hill if I ever saw one.","12476":"Apropos saw: unfortunately the Panda was nowhere to be seen, but it was made up by a lot of penguins, a walk through the wallabies\u2018 enclosure, koalas and a nicely decorated park (a lot of installations explaining celtic legends and history, illuminated in the dark).It was a nice trip, although the park could do with a few more signs as to where to find what (we managed to not find the panda enclosure for quite a while).Getting to and from the zoo is easy, there are many buses going to the city centre every few minutes with bus stops directly in front of the zoo.","12477":"This review is for the nightime lantern event when all the animals are safely tucked up for the night so you don't see any real animals but plenty real and imaginary animals recreated as giant coloured lanterns.","12478":"There is a lantern trail around part of the zoo that takes about an hour and a half to walk round.","12479":"The event is quite simply stunningly beautiful , bright and colourful with a huge variety of artistic lanterns , some that can only be described as GIANT.Thousands of twinkly led lights light up the pathways that take you round an ever changing series of magical scenes , some Chinese and some with a Scottish flavour.","12480":"You will even find Nessie welcoming her Chinese Dragon relative.","12481":"This is not just for kids though they will love the artwork.","12482":"Just remember to wrap up warm as it is winter in Scotland.","12483":"Although I didn\u2019t see the pandas as the indoor area is closed and I missed the penguin parade as I was hugging a radiator in the cafe to keep warm as I was soaked from the torrential rain I had a really good day at Edinburgh zoo.","12484":"The enclosures are fab, the restaurant is lovely, penguin cafe is great, the staff were lovely and helpful, the lanterns were really pretty and it\u2019s easy to get too.","12485":"I\u2019d definitely go again !","12486":"We visited a a day with really heavy rain, even though we were absolutely soaked by the end of the day the zoo was a fantastic day out!","12487":"The only disappointment was that the indoor viewing for the pandas was closed and they had the sense to stay inside!","12488":"There was a few empty enclosures but overall it was a great day out!","12489":"Last year we went to see the Christmas lights at the botanical garden,","12490":"well what a waste of time it was and rip off it was.","12491":"We heard about the zoos lanterns and promised we would go this year, we were not disappointed.","12492":"They are magical and awe inspiring, beautiful and stunning the only thing the food wasn\u2019t up to much.","12493":"If you plan to only visit either the zoo lights or botanical garden lights then take my advice and visit the zoo, you will not be disappointed","12494":"We chose a dull rainy day to visit as we had to take our small dog with us but on arrival we were told we could not leave him in the car and would have to find somewhere to park off site.","12495":"This was not a good start.","12496":"If this was for the dogs welfare then it was rather hypocritical considering the conditions some of their animals were being kept in.","12497":"It also made it very difficult for us to check up on him regularly.","12498":"Now the zoo....","12499":"We have visited lots of zoos this year, in many countries.","12500":"We have been impressed at their dedication to the conservation of endangered species.","12501":"Unfortunately Edinburgh has a long way to go to meet modern expectations.","12502":"Yes, some enclosures are great and very imaginative (penguins, chimps, wallabies) but the majority of enclosures are terrible.","12503":"The zoo as a whole appears run down, with many enclosures empty or just too small.","12504":"It may be that the zoo has put all its money into a few flagship species such as Pandas and Chimps but the pandas were not on show when we visited (I believe one is ill) and the Chimpanzee house had so much wasted space it was ridiculous.","12505":"It was a wet day","12506":"so we did not expect to see much outside but more could have been done to provide covered viewing areas for such occasions.","12507":"As for the price, it was much too expensive and as the zoo had so many empty enclosures it should have reduced the entry price accordingly.","12508":"However, The staff we met were very good and there is, no doubt, much really good work being done by dedicated staff and keepers throughout the zoo, in particular the volunteers who were very knowledgeable and willing to pass on their knowledge readily.","12509":"One more thing....","12510":"The coffee in the penguin cafe was by far the worst I have ever tasted!","12511":"Edinburgh Zoo is an excellent day out if you're staying in Edinburgh or the surrounding area.","12512":"It doesn't look very big from the front but it's clear from the grand old building that it's very old.","12513":"However, once you get inside, the zoo is spread over extensive grounds and it is very well maintained.","12514":"All of the animals and exhibits have been carefully considered and have been designed for maximum viewing possibilities for guests while maintaining privacy and welfare for the animals.","12515":"It was great to see that the zoo is heavily involved with conservation (as any zoo should) and there was plenty of information about their conservation programmes around the zoo as well as during the excellent feeding displays, when one of the staff would give a talk about the animals being fed.","12516":"There's so much to see and do, and we didn't manage to get round the whole zoo with our two-year-old son.","12517":"Maybe with older kids or just adults, it would be possible to see everything.","12518":"Overall, an excellent day out and highly recommended.","12519":"I went here on a very drizzly grey Thursday in November and I loved it.","12520":"It\u2019s definitely worth pre booking to save some money on entry and parking costs \u00a34 for a car all day, but I didn\u2019t mind that as it is primarily a conservation centre","12521":"so I like to think all the money directly benefits the animals.","12522":"No it isn\u2019t the biggest zoo I\u2019ve ever been to, and yes it\u2019s set on a hillside so some of the exhibits are a bit of a trek upwards.","12523":"Plus some of the various enclosures and exhibits were shut during late afternoon.","12524":"However, I thought it was such swell run establishment - the staff are friendly and knowledgable and can\u2019t wait to give you information even outside of the guided talk times.","12525":"It\u2019s the only zoo where I\u2019ve felt like I could get up close to the animals - for example the tiger walked right along side the glass wall through so I was mere inches from the side of his body and the wallabies are just hopping about on the grass next to the path at the outback enclosure.","12526":"I really recommend a visit here if you love animals, and don\u2019t mind a little bit of a hike.","12527":"I have been to the Zoo several times over the years, and I'm afraid to say that this time will be my last, way overpriced, most of the pens and enclosures were empty, a highlight for me has always been the penguins parade, even they couldn't be bothered to come out, the food and drink is a complete ripoff, time to close your doors and concentrate on the conservation work that you do so well.","12528":"If it's raining, it's not the Zoos fault the animals are inside.","12529":"You wouldn't stand outside if it was raining would you?We went today, miserable weather","12530":"but we had a great time.","12531":"Unfortunately we didn't see the pandas due to being in veterinary care but that's ok.","12532":"We did however see a lot of the other animals.","12533":"Due to it being quiet we managed to spend a lot of time with each animal enclosure and got to see a bit of activity.","12534":"I must say the one horned rhino is so sweet.","12535":"He was playing hide and seek with us and one of the zoo keepers.","12536":"3 zoo keepers we met were wonderful.","12537":"The lady with short bobbed brown hair and glasses was phenomenal.","12538":"She explained to us all about the different animals and told us about their personalities and their behaviours and recommended who we should go see next.","12539":"She was also happy for us as we are on our honeymoon, which was lovely.","12540":"The older lady who at the time was with the koalas was lovely.","12541":"She was explaining about the joey and how the koalas live and look after their young.","12542":"Finally the lady in the lorikeet enclosure was brilliant fun.","12543":"I had lorikeets all over me and one even landed on my head.","12544":"The lady took the one off my head straight away (and luckily too as 2 seconds later it had a poo!)","12545":"I would definitely say this was a good zoo.","12546":"Yes you don't see as much when it rains, but surely that's obvious.","12547":"A lot of slopes but not as steep as everyone makes it out to be","12548":"and they also have a car that helps you around if you have difficulty walking.","12549":"Thanks to all 3 ladies who made our day wonderful!","12550":"Visited with my 4 year old in November.","12551":"Edinburgh Zoo is on the side of a hill, so be prepared to cover a lot of vertical distance during your visit.","12552":"This zoo has a number of traditionally exciting exhibits, including a monkey house, a rhino, tigers, lions, and panda bears.","12553":"There are also some unique exhibits, including a wallaby exhibit where you can walk among the wallabys in their enclosure and a penguin exhibit absolutely stuffed with penguins (the highlight of the trip).","12554":"There are also cafes and playgrounds strewn around the zoo, which was great for my kid.","12555":"Finally, you can get an amazing view of greater Edinburgh if you go all the way to the top\/back of the zoo.","12556":"This is exactly what a zoo should be.","12557":"So heavily focused on conservation rather than an animal as an attraction.","12558":"Sure, people moan about the fact it\u2019s on a hill, some enclosures look a little old and dated, and there aren\u2019t animals like elephants and giraffes, but if you take the time to talk to the zookeepers...- they don\u2019t have elephants because they don\u2019t have the space.- they keep animals that are endangered to help support their conservation, as THAT is what zoos should be for.- they keep animals who can survive naturally in the sort of environment Scotland has.- they have the largest Chimpanzee habitat in Europe.- they have Scottish Wildcats, Scotland\u2019s last natural predator, ready for reintroduction into the wild once the feral cat problem has been addressed.- the zoo is old, the city has grown up around it and they make the absolute best of the space they have.","12559":"We followed Barry around as we were lucky enough to walk straight into his talk on meerkats, which then followed onto the Red Panda, then the birds, then the otters, then the penguins, then the chimpanzees, then koalas, then wildcats... then all of a sudden it\u2019s time to go!","12560":"We have never learnt so much before and were so enthused by Barry\u2019s passion, knowledge and commitment.","12561":"There are animals there that people don\u2019t always go to see because they just think they\u2019re normal, eg birds or insects.","12562":"But, chat with Barry and you learn that these are so key to our environment that without them the world as we know it would cease to exist.","12563":"If all insects were to suddenly disappear, the world would fall apart within 50 years.","12564":"Thanks to Barry, we now know that birds rock, cockroaches rock, stick insects rock, wildcats rock..","12565":"they all rock!Honestly, this is the best zoo I have ever been too.","12566":"Remember, next time you go, just why the animals are there.","12567":"They aren\u2019t there simply for you to ogle and stare.","12568":"They\u2019re there because we, as humans, are messing up their own natural environments, to the point where they are now endangered, and we have to provide safe habitats for them to live in until they can safely be released back into the wild.","12569":"WE are messing up this planet for every single living creature, but it\u2019s not too late to fix it.","12570":"Zoos are helping to lead conservation efforts and with our support we can see animals returned to their rightful homes.","12571":"Edinburgh Zoo, to me, was an eye opener.","12572":"Thank you Barry, thank you all who spoke to us.","12573":"We will definitely be returning!","12574":"It's not the best zoo, some of the enclosures look a little old and on the small side.","12575":"But they do have quite the array of species and a fair few that are uncommon for zoos.","12576":"Of course there is the pandas but also moon bears, pygmy hippos, Asian rhino and pelicans.","12577":"Book in advance for a lower price as the walk up price may not be worth it, also the parking is \u00a34.","12578":"A classic Scottish attraction and a good zoo; although the hill (not that it can be helped!) on which it is situated means you don\u2019t ever get a good feel of the zoo as you can only really see the path\/enclosure right in front of you.","12579":"Still, good facilities and a nice day out.","12580":"Cafe (Penguin Cafe in our case) is unjustly expensive.","12581":"An absolute rip off,the place is a dump,more animals in the average local park.","12582":"Totally disgusted do not waste your time and particularly your money","12583":"Full disabled facilities.","12584":"Steep hills.","12585":"If have assistance dog please telephone ahead as only allow dogs for the blind.","12586":"Must have paperwork with you.","12587":"Very child friendly but could be bit pricey for food and drinks.","12588":"Advise you to bring picnic.","12589":"Has playground.","12590":"Staff are helpful and friendly.","12591":"Parking is not free and cost \u00a34.","12592":"Free for blue badge holders.","12593":"Worth a visit to spend a day","12594":"Great Time for all ages.","12595":"Awesome display all over the route.","12596":"Totally worth it \u00a316 ticket bought though Groupon.","12597":"Wee description on each bigger display, wee 15min acrobatic show at certain times, few stops on the way to buy food(overpriced in my opinion) so backpack with sandwiches and thermos with tee is worth consideration.","12598":"Was ca 2h walk so please check weather forecast and wear appropriate clothing.","12599":"Regrettably we found the zoo very unimpressive with very few animals to see and the whole site to look tired and unkempt.","12600":"During our four day trip to Edinburgh we found all other attractions to be well presented and interesting but the zoo proved to be VERY disappointing and poor value for money.","12601":"The keeper who presented the talk on insects was, however, very interesting and enthusiastic.","12602":"A recommendation would be for a CCTV camera to be set up in the female panda's sleeping room to enable visitors to see her.","12603":"Pay a lot to see very little.","12604":"Best part of the zoo is the penguins where you\u2019re actually guaranteed to see them.","12605":"Second trip and thought cooler climate would make a difference but sadly no.Spend best part of the time wandering around looking at empties enclosures or animals that are as far away as eye can see or sleeping.","12606":"Won\u2019t be giving this zoo a third chance.","12607":"Changes need to be made.","12608":"From now on we will be sticking to blairdrummond safari park for a great out.","12609":"I took my teenage, animal-mad daughter as part of a short break to Edinburgh on a very cold but beautiful day.","12610":"Although there was a long queue to get in when we arrived it moved quickly and we didn't feel we waited overlong.","12611":"Entrance price was very fair, I thought, in comparison with London Zoo, for example, and we saw almost every animal through being quiet and patient - we felt it was good value for money.","12612":"Highlights were the red pandas, who seemed to put on a show for us up in the trees; the penguins porpoising and playing in the water; the pygmy hippos having a bath; the rhino wallowing in the mud; the binturongs being fed by the keeper; the monkeys in the Living Links enclosure (we saw a researcher working with some of them, which was fascinating); and last but not least the rainbow lorikeets (take a camera!) which we fed nectar to.","12613":"The site is hilly, but it is what it is and the views are worth it - you need comfortable shoes - and there is a land train.","12614":"We ate at one of the cafes and there was a good choice - slightly pricey, but there are plenty of seats for picnics.","12615":"The zoo is on a good bus route between the airport and the city centre, so it's very accessible and you don't need a car.","12616":"We spent several hours there and are still talking about it some weeks later.","12617":"This is a great zoo with Pandas and Koalas which I had never seen before.","12618":"The enclosures for all animals were excellent.","12619":"The penguins were excellent to watch.","12620":"The zoo is on a hillside and some areas are very steep.","12621":"Had 4 hours plus and still did not see all the areas as the Gibbons and penguins were great to watch.","12622":"Would definitely go back.","12623":"I had a great couple of hours there.","12624":"We saw loads of animals compared to our visit to Dublin zoo where we saw almost nothing.","12625":"I would recommend you to wear comfy shoes if you\u2019re going there!","12626":"There is a lot of walking \ud83d\ude00","12627":"I enjoyed it though.","12628":"We had only two and a half days in Edinburgh and decided to go.","12629":"It was well worth it!!","12630":"Took grandchild to see very little for very much money.","12631":"Needs a refurb and stop living off the pandas.","12632":"One very disappointed child.","12633":"Edinburgh Zoo needs a refit what is there is small and some of the enclosures looked far too small.","12634":"Cafe overpriced and not good either very disappointing.","12635":"Entrance fee is extortionate and not affordable price to many.","12636":"My son and I loved the zoo.","12637":"We're both animal lovers and I did have some reservations about visiting a zoo but there are so many conservation projects that they are involved with that it eased my concerns somewhat.","12638":"We were also fortunate to bump into some of the keepers who were very knowledgeable about the animals which made the experience that much better.","12639":"The penguin parade was fab and there are a few areas where you can get very close to the animals such as the wallaby enclosure.","12640":"Be warned though the zoo is on a hill and it's quite a climb but well worth it!","12641":"I thought my son would maybe last a couple of hours (he's just turned three years old) but we stayed all day!","12642":"So much to see and do and we had a great day.","12643":"This visit was booked as a surprise and I loved every minute of it.","12644":"I was so happy to get a chance to see the pandas (and koalas) in the UK!","12645":"The bus stop is right outside the door and with my birthday being on a Saturday we made sure we were there nice and early to beat any queues.","12646":"Unfortunately upon entry we were told there were no koalas on display due to vet's orders.","12647":"I asked about the pandas and was told they were still on view.","12648":"Using the map I quickly made my way to the pandas to try and see them whilst it was early and quiet.","12649":"Unfortunately the indoor viewing was shut?!","12650":"So the only chance of seeing them was if either of the pandas came outside.","12651":"I wish the zoo had been a little more honest although it made no difference to me as the tickets were pre-booked for that day.","12652":"I managed to speak to a keeper who explained that both koalas and pandas are very sensitive, in particular to noise, and if they stop eating it can cause all sorts of problems.","12653":"I just had to wait until a panda came outside - only they sleep 16 hours a day!","12654":"Oh dear!Luckily the zoo has an online 'panda cam' so I could keep my eye on the male panda to see if he had disappeared from his indoor enclosure.","12655":"This proved to be useful as, whilst in the restaurant, he moved!","12656":"I raced back to the panda enclosure and saw him for 5 wonderful minutes whilst he chomped on some bamboo.","12657":"This was after nearly 5 hours of going backwards and forwards and taking my time around the zoo.","12658":"I would say that I wish some of the public could be more mindful of the notices asking you to be quiet near the pandas - there are play areas for children in the zoo but unfortunately a woman took it upon herself to entertain her daughter playing a very screamy game of hide and seek!","12659":"When you have travelled across the country to see these beautiful animals the last thing you want is ignorant people doing stuff like this.","12660":"Inbetween keeping our eye out for pandas we saw the penguin parade - so cute - and  we were very impressed that the penguins were not forced to do this, hence we only had two penguins, one was called Kevin.","12661":"They have a wide variety of animals and, being a Saturday, it was busy and some of the animals were sleeping or hiding.","12662":"Saw a tiger asleep inside but couldn't see the moon bear at all, definitely hiding!The monkeys were great and wonderful to see that every single monkey had a name and it's photo with it's name and a bit about its character was pinned up, lovely touch.","12663":"The place is quite hilly, and I would say that the lions and baboons were a little far away.","12664":"Visited the restaurant twice during my visit, got a nice bottle of beer each the first time and on the second visit had homemade soup that came in a tin mug with a large slice of bread.","12665":"It was vegetable soup that day and it was absolutely delicious.","12666":"I didn't think it was badly priced at over \u00a35 each.","12667":"At the end of the day if you don't want to pay restaurant prices then take a packed lunch as they are benches available in the zoo.","12668":"I thoroughly enjoyed my visit and want to go back to see the pandas properly and hopefully see the koalas but next time I will phone and check on the day to make sure they are well enough for visitors.","12669":"We decided to go to Edinburgh Zoo on the way back to the airport, which turned out to be a good idea.","12670":"The Zoo is approx half way between Edinburgh centre and the airport and for our evening fight worked well with times.","12671":"The zoo was really fun - Pandas was a highlight, however probably the best bit was Penguin enclosure.","12672":"At 2.15pm they have a \"Penguin Parade\", the penguins come out for a small parade out of there enclosure (but only if they choose to do so, not enticed by fish etc).","12673":"We didnt think we would be lucky until Kevin The Penguin trotted up and tried to make the parade (Kevin apparently is a naughty penguin which has an ASBO for trying to peck his keepers).","12674":"Anyway, they came out paraded around and Kevin nipped his keeper!Overall really fun day and would recommend to check this out especially if you're on way back to airport!","12675":"Visited mid week during English \/ Welsh half term.","12676":"There was a large queue when we arrived, being members of Chester Zoo we were waiting in the prebooked queue that took about 30 minutes to get through.","12677":"I\u2019m not certain why this was the case.","12678":"Food at the cafe was tasty - service was ok - they where woefully understaffed that seemed to lead to some other tables complaining.","12679":"I had to go and find one of the team members to go and pay.","12680":"Zoo is hilly but our 4.5 year oldSon was fine with this and the mix of animals allowed a slight rest between walking.","12681":"I thought signage of where the animals were could be better.","12682":"Many visitors were looking for the pandas that were not initially easy to find -  even when using the map.","12683":"Penguin walk was ace.","12684":"A must if you are at the zoo at this time.","12685":"This is such a lovely zoo, educational, interesting and welcoming.","12686":"We specifically came to see the pandas and got a great view of Tian Tian but also enjoyed lots of other creatures too.","12687":"We listened to a couple of the talks given by the staff and they're well worth waiting for as we learnt a lot.","12688":"I would definitely include this outing as part of your stay in the city!","12689":"A little bit hilly if you have a motorscooter of buggy, the Lion Trail is very hilly and not advisable for the elderly and did not see one Lion.","12690":"The zoo is well kept and the animals are in a very pleasant atmosphere.","12691":"I must say it was very windy and that did not help the experience however I would recommend it as aplace to visit to see the only Panda in a zoo in the UK.","12692":"All the animals looked very well kept, healthy and content, the enclosures are very spacious and adapted to the animals, was gutted we couldn't see the big cats and zebras due to the high winds but very good of the zoo to give a refund even though not there fault.","12693":"On a recent visit too the Zoo with my boyfriend we were left very disappointed.","12694":"The entrance fee for the two of us was \u00a340.","12695":"I wouldn't of minded this apart from the the fact that we hardly saw any animals and the ones we did see just looked miserable...","12696":"We then got two small hot chocolates and two bags of crisps which came to well over \u00a310!","12697":"I understand that the Zoo has to  make money for the up keep of the animals but this place is not worth the time or money....","12698":"Really nice zoo which clearly cares about the animals.","12699":"Unfortunately due to high winds we couldn\u2019t see the lions and tigers as part of the zoo was closed but the rest of day was great.","12700":"Chimps were a particular highlight along with the Panda.","12701":"The whole place is kept in really good order and as mentioned staff seem to really care.","12702":"An enjoyable and educational way to see and learn about a very wide range of animals housed at Edinburgh Zoo.","12703":"We were really looking forward to this trip however we were very disappointed!","12704":"The animals were so far away you can hardly spot them, the lay out is horrific, be prepared for lots of steep walking.","12705":"A lot if animals were hidden away so difficult could see.","12706":"After 1 hour 30 mins we had finished so we thought we would get a drink well because we only wanted hot drinks they refused to serve us because they needed seats in case people wanted food (so people spending more money)Will not return definitely not worth the money at all","12707":"What a wonderful zoo.","12708":"I love that so many enclosures ask for quiet- I\u2019ve never seen this before and think it\u2019s wonderful to show so much respect to the animals.","12709":"Wear sensible shoes as it\u2019s on a hill and lots of walking!","12710":"I highly recommend walking to the hilltop viewpoint as the views are stunning.","12711":"The app is good as it has a map and QR reader to collect virtual stamps.","12712":"Lots of staff who are friendly, helpful and happy to chat about the animals.","12713":"We had lunch in the restaurant and it was nice- but more than I would usually pay.","12714":"We arrived on the bus from the airport and paid to use one of the lockers.","12715":"A fantastic day out","12716":"and we got to see pandas for the first time!","12717":"A really enjoyable day out.","12718":"I was really impressed with the number of knowledgeable and committed volunteers that were round and about in the zoo to give you interesting facts and advise you of the best route.","12719":"Therese in particular was so personable and clearly loved what she was doing.","12720":"I\u2019d never really seen this idea in action but it was so nice to see people who genuinely wanted to be their as opposed to the potential  \u201cjobworths\u201d that can often be found.","12721":"The Pandas were awesome!!!","12722":"Nieve the Rhino was brilliant too!","12723":"Ok so the zoo is on a steep hillside which works the legs!","12724":"It was October so a lot of the animals were inside as it was chilly but we did see one of the pandas on the indoor enclosure.","12725":"The penguin pool is great and fantastic to see them swimming about in a large pool area.","12726":"We ate at the cafe which was pricy and the worst sandwiches we had ever eaten, the sandwich bread was so dry it was terrible and would definitely recommend taking own food to it.","12727":"There was a lack of kiosks open and a huge que at the cafe when all we wanted was a bottle of water later","12728":"so we didn\u2019t bother to que again.","12729":"Park was clean but looked very out of season, hardly any staff about to ask questions to.","12730":"The zoo is worth going to see the pandas but would be very hardwok if you were struggling with mobility and in a wheelchair as there are so many slopes and steps.","12731":"Came to Edinburgh for my girlfriends birthday and thought the zoo would be a good idea and a nice day out","12732":"and oh how wrong we were!","12733":"Barely any animals around and looked like it was unloved, like something out of an apocalypse movie!","12734":"On the plus side we did see a few pigeons and a squirrel \ud83d\ude02 overpriced and definitely not worth it!","12735":"Fantastic place, very clean.","12736":"The animals look well looked after.","12737":"It was great to see the Pandas and the penguins.","12738":"Omg the animals are amazingThe pandas when awake are so cute and adorable I just wanted to take them homePark clean and tidyOn a big hill so great leg work outDefinitely can\u2019t wait to go back","12739":"Honestly, the best.","12740":"Although a little hilly, which you are warned about when purchasing tickets.","12741":"This zoo is amazing...","12742":"Pandas & Koala bears .. penguins, hippos, rhino ..","12743":"SO many animals to see, and not just the usual zoo animals.","12744":"The penguin parade is worth catching if you get a chance","12745":"We had tickets booked for 13th of October but storm Callum meant our train from Lancashire was cancelled.","12746":"We phoned the zoo to explain that we'd got the tickets for our (Panda mad) daughter's birthday and they were very helpful, allowing us to use them any time within the next month.","12747":"The wetaher was much better this weekend but we decided to drive up in the end.","12748":"Very easy to find and helpful staff at the entrance told us the feed of the day and what time certain things were open until.","12749":"First off we had to see the pandas, who were sleeping but it was only 11am so plenty of time to keep going back to see if they were more active.","12750":"The Zoo is set out very well and it's just a great place to walk around.","12751":"I'd read some reviews complaining about how hilly it was, but it's really not bad at all.","12752":"If you get chance, wander up to the view point at the top.","12753":"The views are stunning.","12754":"On our way back to see the pandas we caught the penguin parade, which was cute - event htough there were only about 6 pengiuns doing it!We went back tot he pandas","12755":"and they were both wide awake and playing\/eating and almost posing for pictures.","12756":"It was wonderful to see these animals close up.","12757":"We took our own food and drink as we'd heard about the high prices in the cafes but there was plenty of spaces to eat picnics.","12758":"The gift shop was well stocked and not too expensive.","12759":"All in all, a brilliant family day out.","12760":"Booked the tickets online a few months before going.","12761":"Highly recommend for all ages there is so much to see and do.","12762":"Loved the penguin parade they do never seen this at a zoo before.","12763":"Only downside was food and drink were very expensive once you are inside the zoo.","12764":"I advise people to wear sensible shoes as you do a lot of walking and in some parts it's very steep.","12765":"Overall a great day out.","12766":"Along with our three young grandchildren we enjoyed a wonderful day out in glorious weather in this enchanting zoo.","12767":"Thanks he animals looked well cared for and were active for us to enjoy.","12768":"When added to some lovely playgrounds, ice cream and the penguin parade it made our outing a day to remember.","12769":"Do book in advance if possible to avoid completely the very long queue.","12770":"I love Edinburgh zoo.","12771":"It's a lovely day out, the food isn't great and it is a bit pricey but what you're paying is being put back into the zoo.","12772":"I love how the keepers don't force the animals out for entertainment, they will only come out if they want to which is great.","12773":"Would definitely go again and have been a few times :)","12774":"If you were asked to describe Edinburgh Zoo in just one word, apart from all the wonderful animals there, it would have to be \u201cHilly\u201d.","12775":"The relevance of this to the animals therein became apparent during our visit.","12776":"We were staying on the Corstorphine road so a 10-minute bus journey on the Lothian No:12 or 26 stopped right outside the Zoo.","12777":"When we arrived around 10.00am on a Thursday morning there were no queues and reception was well organised.","12778":"Concessionary price was \u00a317 for seniors (we realised that we could have paid less if booked in advance).","12779":"Previous visitors had noted that several areas were closed or not available for viewing, but there was no evidence of this on our visit.","12780":"As mentioned previously, it soon became clear that good footwear was the order of the day, and we were in for an upward climb during our visit.","12781":"Adequate signposting throughout the Zoo, although there was inadequate seating provided considering the vast area that one covered.","12782":"We were very lucky during our visit to meet up with Barry, one of the Zoo keepers, who conducted an extremely informative talk on the animals.","12783":"He was very down to earth, very knowledgeable and with a pleasant sense of humour.","12784":"He explained, amongst other things, why the Zoo has no giraffes \u2013 simply because they can only tolerate a flat terrain.","12785":"All the animals we saw had large enclosures, to mimic their natural habitat and all seemed well looked after and cared for.","12786":"There were several keepers on duty, who were very willing to answer any questions.","12787":"Having read previous visitor\u2019s comments regarding the high price of food in the Grasslands restaurant, we popped into the Jungle caf\u00e9, and the food options there were totally acceptable in terms of quality as well as price.","12788":"We spent a total of 5-hours in the Zoo, feeling that it had been an enjoyable, informative and worthwhile experience.","12789":"Certainly on a par with other Zoos in the UK \u2013 Edinburgh of course is unique in being the only Zoo in the UK to house a Giant Panda.","12790":"a stunning well layed out zoo.","12791":"offering large enclosures to view to see the animals in comfort.","12792":"very clean and tidy and very environmentally friendly.","12793":"well worth a visit.","12794":"I pre booked our tickets to save some money on line.","12795":"The pandas was a delight to see in there out door enclosure","12796":"Lovely visit to zoo, plenty to see and the children loved it.","12797":"Nice colourful displays dotted around, and although some enclosures seemed empty of animals there was enough to keep the kids happy (maybe the time of year?).","12798":"Be prepared for lots of walking up and down hills!","12799":"Some areas were really tough especially pushing a buggy.","12800":"The real problem was the food, expensive and inedible!","12801":"We bought hotdogs and chips with drinks, 3 adults and a child.","12802":"Cost almost \u00a340!","12803":"For that sort of money i would expect better, the chips\/fries were cold and hard, the hot dog looked and tasted like a piece of rubber hose, just awful, take your own.","12804":"We stayed at the hotel next door and visited the zoo.","12805":"I am not normally one for Zoo's or attractions but to pass the day by we went and I was surprised i really enjoyed it.","12806":"It has some amazing animals and really mesmerizing ones i could not stop staring at.","12807":"I will be back with more family next time.","12808":"Great day out, I used booking.com to book tickets with and got a good discount on the price.","12809":"Lovely day out, plenty to see and the animals are clearly well cared for.","12810":"I should begin by saying we are born and bred Edinburgh residents and we had family visit from England and had not  been to the zoo in years.","12811":"Now I know why .set in lovely grounds looking clean and modern but one thing missing NO ANIMALS.What a rip off I could imagine many young  children being very disappointed don't waste your \ud83d\udcb0","12812":"After looking forward to this trip with our kids (age 9 and 11) who were soooo excited to see the zoo with all its animals that the websites describe - what a thorough and utter disappointment!","12813":"The giant panda didnt even come out of its lair and from speaking to other people in the city - it hardly does.","12814":"Huge space with hardly any other animals, maybe 1 per acre - and the ones that we did see were hard to find in their cages and 80% of them asleep!","12815":"totally overpriced for what it was and I think the zoo keepers should get out a bit more.","12816":"Either they should get with it and see what else they are contending with out in the world that people have seen!","12817":"OR reduce the price considerably - at least it wont hurt so much.","12818":"Please dont go to Edinburgh for this attraction.","12819":"Second time We've been here and it never disappoints.","12820":"Lucky to see the Pandas up close.","12821":"Penguins were the highlight.","12822":"Daughter cost me with the obligatory soft toy on leaving.","12823":"Great day out.","12824":"It's on a hill so be prepared for some exercise.","12825":"Penguins are fascinating.","12826":"The pandas both giant and red were adorable.","12827":"Plenty of talks during the day and some feeding to observe.","12828":"If you are planning to eat in restaurant suggest you go early as it gets quite busy.","12829":"Service was good though.","12830":"Home made soup and pulled pork baguette were good.","12831":"Arrived at 10am and left at 4pm.","12832":"We were lucky to see lots animals (lions, tigers, zebra, both Pandas, red pandas, hippos, penguins, tapir, rhino, Scottish wildcats, Koalas, meerkats etc).","12833":"We all had a brilliant day, well worth the money, it's not too large a zoo built on a hillside and we walked round a few times.","12834":"We took our own picnic in but did buy gifts in the shop.","12835":"Shop is reasonably priced.","12836":"82 acres if nothing went here today with my family.","12837":"Such a disappointment!","12838":"I'm lost for words!","12839":"Hardly any animals.","12840":"In fact i saw more animals at National history museum than at this Zoo.","12841":"Can't recommend this for anyone.","12842":"Well OVER priced for what we got!!I would give a zero but you can't select it!!","12843":"Zero out of ten!!","12844":"Great little zoo, plenty of animals to visit, and At low cost , only down side is it\u2019s set on a very steep hill side","12845":"Edinburgh Zoo is very easy to get to either by car or coach\/bus, and easily accessible by disabled visitors.","12846":"The visitor after paying the entry fee is provided with an easy to read map for the locations of the various animals.","12847":"The good thing was being able to in a relaxed manner stroll around taking one\u2019s time.","12848":"At each animal site there were easy to read descriptions about the animal, such that on leaving that animal you have a good background.","12849":"The only negative were the Lions and Tiger, who seemed to be very bored in their enclosures.","12850":"They seemed to have little to amuse them.","12851":"Overall a very happy enjoyable visit.","12852":"We could only choose 1 thing to do on our day trip to Edinburgh so chose the zoo thought it was poor could not see much  of the animals.","12853":"And there was big que to get in should off pre booked all the same it was expensive and wish we did the castle as we\u2019re disappointed we zoo","12854":"I think that this is a great attraction for families as the prices are reasonable on entry, also, the she was rather large but went down quickly.","12855":"I woild not recommend booking in advance as you still have to sta bnd in the same que as everyone else.","12856":"However, in the penguin cafe the food is over priced and it didn't seem fresh.","12857":"Despite the food I think that everyone should make an effort to visit Edinburgh zoo.","12858":"Visited today with friends, completely underwhelmed by the zoo.","12859":"Loads of enclosures closed for essential maintenance but nothing actually being done.","12860":"It almost turned into a game of find an animal that's not a squirrel (not even part of the zoo).","12861":"Wasn't told there were closures, we travelled from South Wales 7.5 hours to visit the zoo amongst other attractions, really should have stayed at home.","12862":"Very hilly, we found it hard going and we're all fit and well.","12863":"Visited with grandchildren - they had a lovely day- visited all the animals- watched the penguin parade and tried the VR experience.","12864":"It certainly pays to pre book tickets as you don\u2019t have to queue to get into the zoo.","12865":"There are plenty picnic areas and play park facilities.","12866":"When we visited lots of eating places were closed-","12867":"so picnic was a good idea.","12868":"For people with walking difficulties the Zoo offer a transport vehicle to take you from area to area- simple phone call gets the car to you.","12869":"Visited using our Chester zoo membership , great little zoo but extremely hilly ,the disabled vehicle is brilliant","12870":"We came here as members of Chester zoo so got in for free.","12871":"Had a great time and saw all the animals, including the pandas and koalas.","12872":"The penguin enclosure is awesome.","12873":"I enjoyed it but wouldn't rush back.","12874":"there was a lot of walking and it's all on a hill so if you're with young children be prepared to push or carry them up the hill to see the lions etc.","12875":"The penguin rock was pretty big.","12876":"I remember this zoo so much as you start at the bottom and slowly make your way uphill to the top where there are stunning views!","12877":"Plenty of happy animals.","12878":"Easy to get to on a bus from the centre.","12879":"Not too busy and plenty of signs explaining animals etc.","12880":"Great day out","12881":"We were in Edinburgh for a few days break and we\u2019re looking forward to our trip to the zoo.","12882":"Not what we expected at all.","12883":"There is a total lack of animals.","12884":"We looked from all the viewing points inside and out and were more surprised if we did see an animal.","12885":"I understand that some may be nocturnal or prefer to be away from people but to be honest I\u2019d save your money unless you want to risk leaving disappointed like us.","12886":"Amazing!","12887":"I hadn\u2019t been to the zoo since I was really younge and couldn\u2019t really remember it, I was astounded with how big it is!","12888":"There was so much to see it was a miracle we managed to get around it in the 6 hours we were there!","12889":"Honestly could have stayed for so much longer.","12890":"The food was a bit pricy but that\u2019s to be expected inside an attraction, and the BBQ bagget (And macaroni my partner had) were really good, we were so impressed with the gift shop as well!","12891":"The staff were so friendly!","12892":"The animals are beautiful as always, and we did pay to see the pandas that were kind of \u2018on loan\u2019 from China but sadly they didn\u2019t want to come outside\ud83d\ude02so we would have liked a refund on that but not the staffs fault.","12893":"The penguin walk was super cute too, and there is a lot to do","12894":"I love visiting the zoo so myself and my husband came here.","12895":"We\u2019ve been to quite a few and agreed this one was not the best.","12896":"We got there early and there was a distinct lack of animals and it came to the point that we were surprised to see anything in the enclosures.","12897":"Several had indoor and outdoor areas however even after checking these several times (and any other possible area)","12898":"we still couldn\u2019t find some animals, for example the rhinos and the anteaters-they were no where to be found!","12899":"I understand that some animals won\u2019t come outside but I was doubting the existence of the ones that we couldn\u2019t find indoor or outdoors.","12900":"We managed to see some animals like the koalas and even saw the giant panda, that some people didn\u2019t a chance to see.","12901":"The problem with this was that it was very busy and people were standing in front of the panda blocking the view for others- as it\u2019s a seemingly rare occurancd for the panda to appear, it might have been better if there was a zookeeper at the panda enclosure, asking people to move along when they had viewed the panda and taken photos; it seemed this would be a fairer way to do it so everyone could see.","12902":"Certainly the worst zoo I have been too but not horrendous in the grand scheme of things.","12903":"Quite lack lustre.","12904":"We went on Friday 19th October and took our son as a treat whilst visiting Edinburgh.","12905":"We had previously been a few years ago and really enjoyed our visit.","12906":"This visit was shocking.","12907":"We hardly saw any of the animals.","12908":"Alot of empty enclosures and the rhinos,  well think they were camouflaged and in hiding.","12909":"No where to be seen.","12910":"Many enclosures looked unkept and really couldn't see where any improvements had been made or in fact where any of our money goes.","12911":"What was very worrying is the amount of nice that was seen.","12912":"We expect to see some mice at a zoo but this place was infestesd with them.","12913":"Not a nice experience.","12914":"I appreciate that this visit was towards the end of the season however if they know they have less animals to exhibit then they should charge a lower rate for entry.","12915":"We left feeling very deflated and from speaking to Many other visitors on the way round the zoo that day they also felt the same.","12916":"We gave decided that we won't be going back and woukd rather spend a bit money and see the benefits from Chester Zoo where you see where your money is being invested and see much more rewards for their breeding programmes.","12917":"Visited on Thursday for my Penguin Mad Wife's birthday.","12918":"I am not really a zoo person but I have to say it did not disappoint it was a brilliant day out","12919":"and we both thoroughly enjoyed ourselves.","12920":"We managed to see all the animals even the panda which was amazing.","12921":"The actual walk around is enjoyable (even if all uphill) and a lot of thought has gone into the organisation and layout.","12922":"Penguin Rock was amazing as was the parade.","12923":"A lot o people have commented on the price to get in this personally didn't bother us as its about average for any other zoo in the Uk including Chester and Longleat.","12924":"People again commented on the price of lunch, we took a pack lunch because again its a known fact that cafes in attractions are expensive so again this did not bother us.","12925":"The only negatives of our visit are:The fact we had to pay coins to park we don't normally carry coins in the car so it was a bit of a scramble to find (any one wanting to park here you will need \u00a34 in coins).","12926":"However this is cheaper than \u00a310 average to park elsewhere in the city.","12927":"The line to get in although we were not waiting that long and the staff were very friendly and helpful perhaps more desks could of been open as it was half term","12928":"and we arrived by 10:15am fifteen minuets after opening and the ques were outside.","12929":"I think that its a lovely idea that you can feed the rainbow birds and we did something similar in Longleat.","12930":"My only other complaint would be that I felt the keeper here was a little bit abrupt with people in the enclosure.","12931":"If you are going to allow people to feed the birds then they are going to land on people, a bird landed on a gentleman's head and the keeper instantly came over to him and started waving her arms around to get it to move yet didn't do the same to another gentleman who was feeding them.","12932":"The same gentleman was also trying to take a picture of a bird on the tree with his smart phone and she was a little bit short with him this did put us off feeding them and we left the enclosure.","12933":"Came yesterday with my wife and three children- we hadn\u2019t been to Edinburgh Zoo for around 25-30 years each and the kids hadn\u2019t been at all - booked using Kids Pass so paid \u00a340 instead of \u00a357.","12934":"It was well worth it even if we\u2019d paid the \u00a357.","12935":"So much to see and I can\u2019t agree with other reviewers comments about it being tired and having a lot of empty enclosures.","12936":"We all love monkeys and weren\u2019t disappointed with the various monkeys and chimps at different areas of the park.","12937":"My two year old just wandered about the whole time saying \u2018wow\u2019 - after about 10 minutes of being there and having only seen flamingos and chimps we were saying how great the place was -we\u2019ll definitely be back.","12938":"Both of us hadn't been for many years so it was a welcome visit to see the fabulous species within the zoo.","12939":"Depressing to think that the human race is responsible for many of the animals\/birds being in such precarious positions in their environment, but heartening to think that the zoo is acting positively to conserve them.","12940":"All animals\/birds in 1st rate condition which is obviously down to the excellent care by their keepers.","12941":"Penguin parade is a must!!","12942":"Had a great day at Edinburgh Zoo but was left feeling fleeced by the lunch we had in the Jungle Food Court.","12943":"This bares no slight on the cheffing staff in this establishment but the managers who are buying the produce.","12944":"We paid \u00a38.25 for a hotdog and fries.","12945":"Now I was expecting a nice 6\u201d bratwurst with a nice side salad or the like, instead what appeared was a cheap sausage (you\u2019d pick up 10 for about \u00a32 in a jar in a supermarket) that tasted rubbery, a small sub roll and skinny frozen French fries.","12946":"The kids burger was anaemic and came with the same fries we got.","12947":"Total cost of two adult hotdogs, a kids burger and chips and two small fizzy drinks was about \u00a328!","12948":"The total cost to produce these I reckon would have been somewhere in the region of \u00a31\/1.50.","12949":"I don\u2019t mind paying for food but as the saying goes, \u201cyou pay for what you get\u201d!","12950":"Visited for the first time in a few years as we got my 8 year old daughter a zoo keeper experience, she loved it from start to finish, being in before the zoo was open, seeing animals not on show, the mini armadillos, feeding penguins and meerkats, it really was fab as was our keeper.","12951":"Only 2 kids on it too which made it special so thank you","12952":"Having been to Longleat Safari Park earlier in the year I'd hoped for a similar quality.","12953":"Sadly this was not to be the case.","12954":"The enclosures feel rather tired and not caring enough for the animals.","12955":"The chimpanzees were hilarious which lifted this from a 2* to 3*","12956":"Visited today with two young people in tow the zoo was not busy for this time of year and we were in at 10.00.","12957":"It was interesting to see a large number of Chinese Workman putting the lights up in trees and the surrounding area .","12958":"We went last year and it was spectacular .The zoo itself s still under going change it was good to see a new Indian Rhino .","12959":"The penguins as usual and the Sumatran Tiger ,lions ,monkeys galore .","12960":"The other big cats have still to make a return when their new enclosures are built","12961":"Had a great day here.","12962":"Loved seeing all the animals and they are so cuteThe staff were friendly and helpful.","12963":"Was a lovely day and we both enjoyed it well worth a visit","12964":"\u00a319.50 each to enter, \u00a34 parking, \u00a325 for 2 soups and a sandwich, 2 soft drinks and 1 Bakewell tart.","12965":"Would not be a regular visitor.","12966":"Park off site and packed lunch next time.","12967":"Still managed to see all the main attractions which was good, and a nice wander through the grounds which are well kept and litter free.","12968":"Very small and some of the enclosures were lacking for example Lions area looked rather small.","12969":"Only went to see the Panda however didn\u2019t show itself so made up for it by having a very tasty cake in the cafe!","12970":"A very well maintained zoo which is easily reachable from Edinburgh city centre.","12971":"The welfare of the animals is self evident, which I found reassuring.","12972":"The only drawback is that it sits on a hill which could prove difficult for those with disabilities.","12973":"However, there are options offered to combat this upon entering.","12974":"My favourite zoo I've been too.","12975":"Lots of animals with lots of space.","12976":"They seem really well cared for.","12977":"Lots to see and do so admission fee is worth the time you spend there.","12978":"Would recommend and would go back.","12979":"Was amazing to see Panda's in real life!","12980":"Title says it all really.","12981":"High point for me was getting to see a panda!","12982":"VERY steep in places so maybe not so good for very elderly or infirm people.","12983":"Was also a little disappointed that the koalas and African hunting dogs exhibits were closed.","12984":"Can't comment on the caf\u00e9 as I didn't have anything in there.","12985":"Came here on a monday during term time so lovely and quiet, no crowds.","12986":"Loved seeing all the animals, especially the chimps, tiger, pandas and penguin.","12987":"Penguin parade is fantastic and a great feature i havent seen at a zoo before.","12988":"Koalas and a few other enclosures closed but still saw plenty of animals, all of which look well looked after.","12989":"Great walk through enclosures and facts along the ways.","12990":"There are some steep hills about but nothing we couldnt manage with our 3 year old.","12991":"Only bad point is the cafe price, only one cafe open and very over priced!!","12992":"Take your own drinks and snacks!!","12993":"I love Edinburgh as a city and I also love visiting wildlife centres and zoos, however this was a disappointing and costly day out.","12994":"Lots of uphill walking, limited information, very few places to eat and the Penguin cafe was very expensive for sandwiches and toasties, many empty enclosures with animals neither visible in their homes or outside in their \u201c natural\u201d environment.","12995":"Virtually no monkeys to be seen and the ones that were visible were sad; showing repetitive behaviour ( as if often the case with animals in small spaces who are used to being wild)","12996":"The tiger was also repeatedly walking the same circuit and looking glum.","12997":"Lots of people unhappy with the lack of animals given the entrance fee.","12998":"On a positive note the male and female Pandas were beautiful.","12999":"So for this amount of money that they charge I really expected something so much more and better.","13000":"Many animals were not to be seen.","13001":"I don't know if they were hiding or not, but they were not visible.","13002":"You should be charging half.","13003":"Best day ever, came to the zoo to see the pandas and kolas but the kolas was closed which I didn\u2019t mind.","13004":"Went to the panda but first but they were not out so went around the whole the zoo.","13005":"Plenty of hills but the views are amazing.","13006":"As we were nearly done we went back to pandas to see if they were out and they were.","13007":"It was just amazing experience to a wonderful day.","13008":"Also the penguin area was amazing and to see the penguins swimming up and down was just amazing.","13009":"Will definitely be returning to the zoo.","13010":"A really nice zoo with plenty to see and lots of different ways to see them, particularly liked being able to see the penguins swim up close and being able to walk through a filet up close with wallabys.","13011":"Be prepared for plenty of hill walking as it can be a bit much for something.","13012":"Big down side to our trip is unfortunate the pandas decided to stay inside the whole time we were there and inside viewing was closed.","13013":"I am personally not a big fan of zoos, rather prefering to see the animals in wildeness.","13014":"But I found the Edinburgh facilities quite animal friendly, with a lot of space , quite hilly.","13015":"And the pandas, obviously, are hillarious funny!","13016":"I think they brought a pair something like 7 years ago...you need to pay for their show!","13017":"A fantastic day out that's ideal for all the family.","13018":"Educational as well as fun.","13019":"The penguins are a great attraction chasing the bubbles is hilarious.","13020":"Being a big lover of zoos I had been looking forward to Edinburgh zoo for sometime.","13021":"Unfortunately it turned out to be disappointing.","13022":"Everything at the zoo is ridiculously overpriced, something you don't necessarily mind if the rest if the park is up to scratch.","13023":"There were lots of empty enclosures and most of the indoor viewing areas were closed so a lot of the animals could not be seen.","13024":"I enjoyed the penguins and the main highlight of the day were the Scottish wildcat kittens.","13025":"Having been to a lot of zoos I have to say that this one is my least favourite.","13026":"We were really looking forward to the trip but unfortunately we were really disappointed.","13027":"So many empty enclosures.","13028":"If your happy seeing penguins, monkeys and an owl for \u00a350 entry fee then go for it.","13029":"A lovely zoo.","13030":"It's not the best I've been too but well worth a visit.","13031":"Very hilly so not an easy walk around.","13032":"Spent a lovely 4 hours here.","13033":"We had a really fun day out at the zoo, taking in some Autumn sunshine.","13034":"We were greeted and served by Abbie at the ticket counter who was really helpful and friendly and went the extra mile to double check if we needed any extra help.","13035":"Dropped one star due to so many of the animals being either unspottable or closed (koalas were away for health reasons).","13036":"The staff are the zoo's main asset - they were all extremely enthusiastic and we particularly enjoyed the penguin parade which was led by a really engaging man who then went onto do a talk all about them, sharing some amazing facts.","13037":"Will definitely be back again!","13038":"My kids loved seeing all the animals.","13039":"I took a packed lunch with me as I read reviews about the food being expensive.","13040":"There are plenty toilets and rest stops for them that need them.","13041":"We made sure we seen all the animals in the zoo before heading off home.","13042":"We had a full day here and loved every second.","13043":"Rather disappointed wit the zoo due to Panda not to be on show that day and many hiding away, could be due to weather as not a warm one.","13044":"But......the huge area the Penguins have was amazing","13045":"and we loved them.","13046":"Staff very aware of the animals needs.","13047":"Staff are lovely and friendly, but disappointing that so many of the little shops dotted around the park are closed, the train to the top is a welcome hand, older man on the train is amazingly funny and informative, more expensive than many more attractions that are better","13048":"Went here with son and we weren't disappointed.","13049":"There was massive queue to get in but after 30mins we were thru the door.","13050":"My son's favourite was the pandas, mine was the penguins.","13051":"Even got to see 2 wee penguins out on their trail round the park with the junior rangers.","13052":"Theres plenty of places if youre taking your own picnic lunch.","13053":"Nice wee gift shop at exit to buy your favourite stuffed animal or other souvenirs.","13054":"Fantastic day.","13055":"Would highly recommend for young and old.","13056":"Would like to make it a yearly tradition.","13057":"If there was only one thing that annoyed me it was the parking.","13058":"\u00a35 charge in hotel carpark next door.","13059":"With the amount they take for entrance there should be some sort of setup where they could reduce this amount.","13060":"Wonderful visit, free-flowing visit to panda exhibit, lucky to spend an hour watching Sunshine outdoors.","13061":"Lovely meal & friendly staff in restaurant.","13062":"I had been bugging my husband to take me to the Zoo whilst on our first ever trip to Edinburgh and honestly, I sort of wish we hadn't bothered.","13063":"The Zoo is easy to get to, on main public bus routes which was handy.","13064":"The front entrance and gift shop looks modern and clean, but the ticket prices were a little steep (I'll come back to steep in a moment).","13065":"Cost about \u00a340 for the two of us to get in","13066":"and then we set off.","13067":"I have a disability after a spinal operation, and had been warned of the zoo being on a hill but DEAR LORD I did not expect it to be quite as steep as it was.","13068":"I know that the zoo offers a car service, but I am too stubborn to accept help and so tried to do it alone.","13069":"The animals looked healthy and cared for, but we didn't see a lot of them.","13070":"The painted dogs were inside and not on view, as were the Koalas.","13071":"The Panda was inside, we couldn't see the Lions and there was only one Tiger who was asleep.","13072":"All in all, I felt it was a bit meh.","13073":"Penguins were awesome though.","13074":"The reviews on here did nearly stop us going and I can see if you advertise pandas and koalas as your central attractions and then only let people know when they get there you cannot see them then it is not going to please people.","13075":"However....","13076":"There are a lot of animals in here and they are kept in imaginative surrounds, especially the tiger.","13077":"The top end of the zoo is spacious and peaceful and it is maybe best to start up here and wind your way down.","13078":"In the middle the penguin exhibit allows you to really see the animals up close and the pelican walkthrough again is original.","13079":"We did see the male panda which is clearly a unique sight.","13080":"Also viewing Scottish Wildcats was great, these are a very local endangered species and they need the attention they rightly get.","13081":"The hill is steep, so a land train or, as at Dudley Zoo which is also steep, a chairlift would help (would raise revenue as well).","13082":"Yes there is mobility help but many people would find this hard who are not mobility impaired.","13083":"All in all there is lots in here, some imaginative exhibits, good pricing and an easy to access location.","13084":"However there is a feeling it has a fading glory, not particularly full on a weekend for example, which needs to be addressed as there is much more positive than negative about this place.","13085":"Very expensive.","13086":"Lots of hills.","13087":"Lots of empty pens but still loads to see.","13088":"It is a good day out for the kids.","13089":"Have visited here three times before over about 25 years and sadly it's going downhill nowadays.","13090":"No giraffes or elephants anymore, even the zebras are down to one.","13091":"All the rest of the animals are sadly depleted in number.","13092":"It seems it's all about the pandas these days even though the chance of actually seeing one is pretty remote as they sleep most of the day and you can't visit the sleeping viewing area.","13093":"Basically you can only see them on your phone on panda cam.","13094":"I've visited both Berlin and Madrid zoo 2 years ago and the pandas were out all day so thankfully I've seen some before, my daughter sadly hasn't seen any so was a little disappointed.","13095":"The Koalas were also off limits and you couldn't visit the Lemur walkthrough.","13096":"Even the penguins were reluctant to go on parade.","13097":"I felt a little sorry for the solitary tiger who paced back and forth looking thoroughly bored.","13098":"The enclosures were very clean and the animals are obviously well cared for","13099":"but I'm afraid it's not the zoo it once was.","13100":"Was a nice day out, lots of walking to do, but a wide variety of animals, quite a few of which I have not seen before.","13101":"Pandas were gorgeous.","13102":"Beautiful setting and easy to get to on Lothian buses from Edinburgh central.","13103":"Be aware that the zoo is built on the face of a hill, therefore, being able to walk uphill is important for full enjoyment.","13104":"The highlight of the zoo is the penguin parade, scheduled every day for early afternoon.","13105":"However, the penguins get to decide it they're going to parade or not, and the day we were there, they chose not to.","13106":"Many of the animals stayed inside their pens on this day.","13107":"However, the meerkats (love them!), penguins, and pandas were on full view, showing off for visitors!","13108":"Lots to see here.","13109":"Get ready to walk as its on a hill.","13110":"If you plan the day, you can easily spend the whole day here and get your moneys worth.","13111":"Parking is free on the bus lanes from 9.30-4pm","13112":"but I wouldn't bother as there are regular bus services to get you there.","13113":"Take plenty of snacks, pack a packed lunch and bring money for the gift shop.","13114":"We planned on spending the morning here and then heading to Edinburgh Castle.","13115":"However there was so much to see here we spent a lot longer here than we anticipated.","13116":"The chimpanzee and penguin enclosures were fantastic.","13117":"There were always keepers near by to share with us their expertise too.","13118":"All the enclosures seemed to be spacious and well designed for each of the animals.","13119":"The only disappointment we had was not seeing the panda bears but this was just unfortunate as they remained hidden from our view.","13120":"Just be prepared to do a lot of walking up and down the steep slopes.","13121":"Loved Edinburgh zoo when I was little so decided to revisit.","13122":"Unfortunately an awful lot of the animals were closed and a few staff were nice and helpful but most weren\u2019t.","13123":"Wouldn\u2019t recommend.","13124":"The Zoo is well laid out and the (limited) range of animals seem to have plenty of stimulation.","13125":"However, we must have been unlucky with our choice of days to visit as most the animals were inside and many did not put in an appearance.","13126":"Many disappointed panda fans!The penguins were, as usual, brilliant and the sun bears, when they finally appeared, put on a good performance.","13127":"Visited last year just after the panda mating season.","13128":"When we arrived they informed us that the indoor panda exhibition wasn't available as the female panda's hormones had not leveled so it was best for less human contact, and so you'd only be able to catch a glimpse if they came outside.","13129":"We understand that they're wild animals, and there's no guarantees of getting to see any of the animals, but apparently this had been the case for weeks.","13130":"A simple note on the website, or when you book a slot to see the panda's online just highlighting this Information would have been nice, a few others in the queue were quite annoyed with this too.","13131":"We weren't happy seems we'd traveled 280 miles specifically to see the panda's!The rest of the zoo was just okay.","13132":"I think we must have picked one of the worst days ever to visit as the lion enclosure was also closed.","13133":"Big cats were sparse, and were small exhibitions, and everything  else is a blur.","13134":"The only saving grace was the penguin exhibition.","13135":"Not recommended.","13136":"Went here with our 20 month old son.","13137":"It was expensive to get in which I didn't mind until I got in and seen that a lot of the enclosures were either empty or the indoor viewing areas were closed.","13138":"Whilst I understand that there are times when animals may need quiet time we were only informed that the koalas were closed for medical reasons.","13139":"We were not however told that the wild dogs, giant panda amongst others internal viewing areas were closed which was very disappointing (ended up consoling the wee one with a \u00a33 panda balloon so at least he got to see one even if it was inflatable)Also food is really expensive.","13140":"\u00a327 for 2 adult sandwiches, 2 hot drinks and a kids lunch box with a tiny sandwich in it!I was very disappointed and don't think we would have went if we had known about the internal enclosures being closed what with it being a miserable day weather
