    "#### Getting Started with the Notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the code in this notebook is already written for you. Your job is to run the cells and explore the outputs to understand what's happening. You're free to explore and change parameters and see how the results change!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To run any code cell:\n",

    "- Click inside the cell\n",
    "\n",
    "- Press `Shift + Enter` (or use the ▶ button at the top of the notebook)\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you work at **Edinburgh Zoo** and your job is to help improve the experience for future visitors. Every day, people write online reviews describing what they liked (or didn't like) about their visit. These reviews contain valuable feedback — but they are written in free-form text and can quickly become overwhelming.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you had only ten reviews, you might be able to read them all yourself and spot patterns. But what if you had hundreds or thousands?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** comes in. NLP is a field of Artificial Intelligence that allows us to extract structure and meaning from human language. By combining a set of smart tools, we can automatically process visitor reviews, identify which animals are mentioned, understand the emotions expressed about them, and summarise the main opinions — all without having to read every sentence ourselves."

    "#### What We're Trying to Do\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to answer questions such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Which animals do visitors **mention most**?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- *What do people **like** or **dislike** about different animals?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Are there any consistent **complaints** or **highlights**?*\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Can we produce a **summary for each animal** based on real visitor feedback?*\n",

    "#### Why Not Just Ask ChatGPT?\n",
    "\n",
    "You might wonder: *why not simply copy all the reviews into a tool like ChatGPT and ask it to summarise them?*\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Scale and Structure:** LLMs work best when given well-structured, focused inputs. Feeding in an entire review dataset — thousands of unrelated sentences — without any filtering or organisation would produce vague or unreliable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Transparency and Control:** By splitting the task into parts (e.g. identifying animals, measuring sentiment, visualising results), we can understand what is happening at each stage. This not only builds trust in the results but also gives us flexibility to tune or troubleshoot specific steps."

    "#### Why This Is Helpful\n",
    "\n",
    "This result shows how a single paragraph can be neatly split into focused thoughts:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentence 1** talks about *animals* (penguins and giraffes)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentence 2** is about the *gift shop*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentence 3** focuses on the *staff*\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sentence 4** reflects on the *overall experience*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By working at the sentence level, we can now link specific opinions to specific topics — like *individual animals* — instead of just tagging a vague overall mood.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now Let's Do This for Every Review\n",
    "\n",
    "We've now seen how to split a single review into sentences. Next, we'll apply this to the entire dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will give us:\n",
    "\n",
    "- One sentence per row\n",
    "\n",
    "- Clearer, more focused units of analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- A better foundation for tasks like animal detection and sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's build the full sentence-level dataset now."

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's now use a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to help us make sense of what visitors actually said about each animal.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- Understand the full set of comments for one animal\n",
    "\n",
    "- Identify common themes and sentiments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generate a short, natural-language summary\n",

    "\n",
    "#### What's a Language Model (LLM)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Language Model** is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) trained to understand and generate human language.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It has read **huge amounts of text** — like books, articles, and online conversations.\n",

    "\n",
    "- You can give it a **prompt** (like “Summarise these sentences”) — and it will try to respond like a human would.\n",
    "\n",
    "When a Language Model is trained on billions of words and has billions of parameters (internal weights), we call it a **Large Language Model**, or **LLM**.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- ChatGPT\n",
    "\n",
    "- Claude\n",
    "\n",
    "- Mistral\n",
    "\n",
    "- LLaMA\n",
    "\n",
    "- Gemini\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Will We Use It?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll ask the LLM to **read all the visitor comments** about a specific animal and **generate a short summary**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This will help us quickly uncover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common reasons why people liked it\n",
    "\n",
    "- Typical issues or disappointments\n",
    "\n",
    "- Patterns in the feedback (e.g., excitement, boredom, confusion)\n",

    "- There are **dozens or hundreds** of mentions\n",
    "\n",
    "- You want to **save time** and avoid reading everything manually\n",
    "\n",
    "- You need to make **decisions** about animal care, signage, or marketing\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How Does It Actually Work?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We collect all the sentences where an animal was mentioned.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. We create a **prompt** like:\n",
    "   > “Summarise what zoo visitors say about the penguin. Include common opinions, emotions, and experiences.”\n",
    "\n",
    "3. We feed the prompt and sentences into the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
