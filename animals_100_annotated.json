Can get similar items on Amazon for £7.The other trinkets and souvenirs are equally as ridiculously priced.I see the zoo reply with explanations of \"oh but the money goes to the animals.\"But that doesn't make the price gouging any less off-putting.We won't be back."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.862043Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T11:24:57.067135Z","inner_id":15,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":16,"annotations":[{"id":16,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":284,"end":289,"text":"Rhino","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"K19mFhvaq3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":291,"end":295,"text":"Lion","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"N6snjpt0hb","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":297,"end":303,"text":"Chimps","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"EblE3P9TuJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":305,"end":311,"text":"Sloths","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"Q021Z8ofcZ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:25:34.792718Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T11:25:34.792731Z","draft_created_at":"2025-07-01T11:25:20.516106Z","lead_time":30.424,"prediction":{},"result_count":4,"unique_id":"3a615300-003f-40f9-acf9-176d0a05de8d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":16,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Zoo Keeper Experience","Text":"My partner booked us a Zoo Keeper experience day for my birthday.

It was a nice enough day and we enjoyed our walk around. We headed up hill to the right first taking it all in along the way. You don't walk far between animals so the hill doesn't seem so daunting,  steep in bits though. We had an ice cream\/ coffee stop first and a play at play park. Then continued up to the top of the hill where we got chips and juice for lunch.  Ice cream again on way back down. Our 4 year old managed until around 3.30pm before needing a stroller but I just popped down and hired one then (£7.50 + £10deposit) - it was a life saver for the last couple of hours.

There, she explained all the Health & Safety and we set off to the buff cheeked Gibbons enclosure. Gibbons cleaned out and breakfast fed, we set off to see Otto in the pygmy hippo enclosure. Gillian got to feed him with a pair of tongs for safety. He was so cute and likes a carrot or 10! He even managed a poo whilst we were there 😂😂. Natalie had warned us this would happen. Next stop we went to see the armadillos and sloths. Gillian got a feed and a hold of a 3 ringed armadillo. So cute, but huge claws on them. Cheeky wee feed of the sloth and we were off again, to see the penguins and feed them. Gillian got to go into the penguin enclosure and feed them some fish, which she absolutely loved.

I loved Hannah's \"positive vibes\" she's a delight and credit to the team and clearly well suited to the role.Additionally at the sloths house a lady called Emma was able to give lots of information on the sloths and armadillo and we were totally entertained and educated.It's obvious the staff here are good at their jobs and the animals respond to this."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.862268Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T11:34:24.711557Z","inner_id":26,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":27,"annotations":[{"id":27,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:34:32.870438Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T11:34:32.870455Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.159,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"782b6e00-a5d6-487e-be69-593be99675c4","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":27,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Lovely zoo and lots of animals","Text":"We pre booked the week before, sadly on the day the weather wasn’t great , windy and rain , but we went ahead and actually enjoyed the visit , lots of animals to see and the restaurants where reasonably priced , and lots of toilets at various points , highly recommend visiting."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.862287Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T11:34:32.881713Z","inner_id":27,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":28,"annotations":[{"id":28,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":153,"end":161,"text":"penguins","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"WBEGakVvXJ","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":166,"end":175,"text":"capybaras","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"8XXpAFiNi3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":481,"end":485,"text":"goat","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"T5ojbpbb6j","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":538,"end":542,"text":"goat","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"mrXLaprapC","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":590,"end":594,"text":"goat","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"7XZxAroRi3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":982,"end":986,"text":"goat","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"iGIqJWyZAl","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":744,"end":748,"text":"goat","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"iGlhsBIXEg","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:37:31.599602Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T11:37:31.599615Z","draft_created_at":"2025-07-01T11:34:43.598300Z","lead_time":177.896,"prediction":{},"result_count":7,"unique_id":"fcf1849a-6c9d-4099-a4d5-a29bfe032b9b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":28,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Decent zoo but some parts unsuitable for children.","Text":"We took our young child to the zoo in the hopes that we could educate him about wildlife and animal conservation.

The penguins were also a joy to watch—many of them were nesting and had eggs, which was such a special thing to see up close. Having visited zoos, safaris, and wildlife parks both across the UK and abroad, we’ve seen our fair share, but this place truly stands out. Considering my husband works in animal welfare and knows his stuff, the fact that he loved it too says a lot. The enclosures looked thoughtfully designed, and the animals all seemed well cared for.

The park in general is on a hill, so lots of walking but pushchairs and wheelchairs are available, the park is clean and well maintained.We really wanted to see haggis, but apparently he's lazy and doesn't wake up till early afternoon, we went in 3 times to try and see him, but sadly only saw him asleep. We did find that lots of the animals are sleeping early, we arrived about 11, and saw more animals up and active in the afternoon.The chimps, big cats and giraffes were all worth the effort to see.The park has a few play parks of good value, a large one by the penguins and another near the chimps.We did want to see the penguin parade, online seemed to suggest it was still a thing, but couldn't work out if it was on. The QR code scanner didn't really answer the question, so we hung about hoping it was on, but sadly not. A nice bit sign would have been good!Meal wise we at at the grasslands, limited choices for my dairy free son.

I can imagine it would be challenging pushing someone in a wheelchair or if someone is physically challenged or has health issues.We went into The Gannet for lunch. Although the coffee was nice, the food and drinks were pricey. The Grasslands Restaurant and the Penguin Cafe were closed which was understandable as it's out of season.We were disappointed as many of the enclosures were empty or closed for refurbishment. I'm aware work needs to be done to ensure that the zoo is maintained but charging £29 for an adult ticket is extortionate.

Better than I had expected!Overall there were loads of interesting animals, almost all set up in a way that you could get a good or exciting view of them. We both were stopped in our tracks seeing the lions, tigers, zebras and giraffes in particular.Even where animals were sleeping you could often still get a good view of them through various observation windows. The one exception was Haggis, the celebrity baby pigmy hippo. In the end we had to visit the enclosure 3x to see Haggis live, with our 1st 2 stop offs being a little disappointing. I can’t help but feel a viewing window or video screen with live webcam of the sleeping area would have helped give the hippos the peace they needed whilst also giving visitors a little something.Food; We had lunch at the Grasslands restaurant. For kids it was slightly “beige” but was not outrageously priced for a tourist attraction, service was quick, the restaurant clean and my soup very nice. When the food arrived I didn’t begrudge the spend but equally can understand why some would bring their own picnics.The zookeeper talks were quite fun and informative although it was a shame there were only 2 throughout the day, we would have happily visited more!One Warning: if you struggle with mobility maybe this isn’t the zoo for you. Some paths are steep (although to be fair  they’re marked as such on the free map)  and the whole zoo is situated on a hill. That said, we saw plenty of folks happily pushing prams around so don’t be put off just because you have little ones.Tip: take at least 2 of the maps as you enter the zoo…. Whilst the new maps may now be easier to recycle,  your average child navigating with one will have accidentally ripped it to shreds within the first 90mins."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.862639Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T11:50:10.241390Z","inner_id":44,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":45,"annotations":[{"id":45,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":283,"end":290,"text":"Giraffe","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"NPPXDrMiz3","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:50:24.853820Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T11:50:24.853835Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":13.443,"prediction":{},"result_count":1,"unique_id":"517b0253-8813-40fd-9112-25e5054bb13d","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":45,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Very clean and big zoo,would visit again maybe in the summer.","Text":"Fairly priced as it is a big zoo.

We went to the tiger talk at the beginning and we spoke with keep Maurice who was great, informative and lovely to talk to. We later saw him at the waddle walk in the afternoon. DO NOT MISS THIS. It was the best thing I’ve ever witness at a zoo… I’ve worked at Longleat and I was very impressed with this idea. It was enjoyable, funny, and most importantly save for the penguins. We got lots of info about the penguins waddling by. It was fantastic! We laughed when we found out it was in a hill but that didn’t matter to us. I believe they have support for those that need it. It was great to hear about the conservation and any keeper\/volunteer we spoke to were very passionate! We loved every mother. The giraffe house and chimp house were very impressive. We had a picnic that day so not sure what care was like. Gift shop was lovely and reasonable pricing! I got a little teddy penguin and magnet for under £10. Ticket prices were fine, it all goes towards the lovely animal so we appreciate this a lot. The map was great and we planned our visit well. Some enclosures were empty but not too many. Some animals were not to be seen, but that was to be expected as they are not their to be on display! We loved every moment and I’m so sad that I live far down south because I would definitely apply to be keeper or be a member. There was a lovely atmosphere and the staff were very lovely to talk to which just made it for us. Thank you Maurice for your talks. I will return one day!

We really enjoyed the penguin waddle which takes place at 14:15 at the weekends and we managed to see Haggis the new hippo. Only thing that did catch us off guard was how much of a slope the zoo is on. It’s very steep and I can imagine would be very inaccessible for those who struggle to mobilise.

What we saw more of was penguins, flamingos, giraffes and meerkats. Also three zebra and two anteaters.It seems that many of the enclosures are empty. Signage is poor- no sign to the top of the hill for example - and had we not followed other people up there we would not have got to the giraffes. A properly marked trail so you get to see everything and don’t go down dead ends would be so much better. Thank goodness we had a paper map otherwise it would have been hopeless.The view from the top is lovely. The sun was shining and it was picturesque.Some of the enclosures look as though they have had a lot of money spent on them like the penguins and the giraffes. Others don’t.

You can see on the map where the hills are, so just make sure you keep this in mind. Giraffes for example at the very top of the hill which means you get amazing views from the top but just make sure you’re not continuously going up and down ideally plan to go up the hill before lunch so you have plenty of time to see everything you need to before coming down for food.The zoo itself is a really great zoo, loads of amazing animals to see and really good enclosures.They have a really great area for the chimpanzees, with really great viewing platforms where you can watch them playing and having fun.The exhibition is also really great for viewing the giraffes and seeing them up close  and safely.I think the zoo did a really good job of making a lot of the viewing areas accessible to smaller children, so I didn’t often have to lift my toddler up to see. The penguin exhibition was a great example of this when my toddler actually ended up standing right next to a penguin through the glass , which she loved.The food at the fish bar was understandably quite pricey, but you actually got a great portion size for the money and the quality was very good.Despite going as a cold time of year it was still extremely easy to see all the animals. Not a lot of them were outside but the indoor closures were well maintained and it was still easy to see them. It did rain at points but there was a lot of errors undercover, especially the chimpanzee area which had a hole inside a bit that was completely completely undercover and nice and warm."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.864662Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:16:58.487273Z","inner_id":72,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":73,"annotations":[{"id":73,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":135,"end":142,"text":"Penguin","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"Xp9HLAknnL","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T13:17:40.168737Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:17:40.168745Z","draft_created_at":"2025-07-01T13:17:13.039393Z","lead_time":40.673,"prediction":{},"result_count":1,"unique_id":"60f51b94-0cbe-4b70-8c2d-b1d46d8090ac","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":73,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Poor Kiosk Customer service marred the experience","Text":"Arrived just after lunchtime (Sat 7th Sept)  and most of the places selling food were closedHad popped into the ice cream kiosk at the Penguin House and said we would be back after grabbing a coffee from the cafe next door.

So far I would highly recommend the annual adult membership, it is £6.40 a month. Kids under 3 are free! :-) It gives you free parking and money off on food & drink. I can visit as many times as I like for a year.  The membership also gives your guests money off the admission if they are not members which I haven't used yet so not sure of the price.  The membership allows you access from a gate at the top of the carpark also to save waiting in any queues in the main entrance area.The zoo is set on a hill side which can be hard whilst pregnant and pushing a buggy.  The very kind reception staff can organise a van to take you to the top of the hill so you can work your way down which is just amazing! The driver also gives you lots of information on the way up about the names of animals etc.  The staff were very helpful and lovely to us. However, it would be hard going up hill with the buggy as some places are quite steep.As for the verity of animals, it's great.  My 15month old toddler can even spot them.  We have visited in the rain and there are lots of indoor enclosures to hide in. The paths are great for a toddler to run around and peak in the enclosures and plenty of buggy friendly zones.There are lots of places to sit and have a picnic too which is great, saves buying food on every visit.So far, very happy with the membership and we are excited to return regularly."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.864725Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:18:37.291258Z","inner_id":75,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":76,"annotations":[{"id":76,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T13:18:41.713379Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:18:41.713392Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":3.313,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"9d26a821-5a4e-4797-b2b7-42fbd5a63d84","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":76,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Excellent zoo for the kids and family","Text":"Fab place the animals are all well looked after, the park is clean and tidy the kids and family and friends loved it.Reception staff friendly and it’s very easy to get to the zoo!"},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.864744Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:18:41.724651Z","inner_id":76,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":77,"annotations":[{"id":77,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":150,"end":158,"text":"Penguins","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"wGzJuuEaRk","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":163,"end":171,"text":"giraffes","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"oIrmqAFmLG","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T13:18:52.006489Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:18:52.006501Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":8.813,"prediction":{},"result_count":2,"unique_id":"b9307c02-5c7d-45b9-8068-334bb27b2588","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":77,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Tired and run down","Text":"Visited the zoo for the first time in a couple of years and was disappointed.

I have even been lucky enough to meet some of the more famous members of staff such as Alison and Darren, who were very kind and helpful, as well as being open to questions.In recent months I really like Lego sculptures that were added around the Zoo, and were excellent to see - Its just a shame that they were only temporary. In the past I have also enjoyed events such as the Great Lanterns of China etc, I feel its a shame that the Zoo doesn't seem to do as many of these events anymore, although I was also lucky enough to attend some of the Panda themed events last summer which were very highly sought after.This leads into my point as to partly why I am giving the Zoo an 'average' rating, I feel that the RZSS\/Zoo could have done more to try and keep their Pandas a bit longer, or at least - attempt to replace them, which has happened at a number of Zoos around the world such as Vienna , Adelaide (Australia) and Washington etc.While we were lucky to have them for an extra 2 years during Covid, I feel like they were a very big draw for Edinburgh Zoo , and even the gift shop does not stock Panda items anymore, even though they are still fondly remembered by regular Zoo goers such as myself, in a similar way that Wendy the elephant in Bristol is remembered, even though Bristol Zoo is no longer even an entity. In short, while it may not be entirely their fault - I feel a bit disappointed by the current leadership of Edinburgh Zoo with regards to this.My second point is the cessation of the Penguin Walk, which was another big draw for this Zoo - and another element that made it memorable and unique (In the same way the Pandas did) , Initially the Penguin Walk was stopped at the beginning of Covid, but 5 years on - It seems the RZSS have no desire to bring it back with it simply being 'postponed' on their website, I dont know if this is because of insurance issues but i think the RZSS need to be honest as to why they have decided the Penguin Walk wont be coming back , I am aware that there are also no outbreaks of bird flu in Scotland since summer 2023 either.I do understand that they will be some new animals coming to the Zoo (such as the Cheetah and hopefully, a new species of bear) which is great, however, to reiterate I feel the Zoo has taken the wrong approach to some of the recent issues in my review, and in my view - Its partly why the Zoo does seem to be less busy than it used to be in years gone by, which is a shame because as a long term member I want to see it succeed."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.864850Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:22:14.144631Z","inner_id":81,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":82,"annotations":[{"id":82,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T13:22:22.458574Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:22:22.458587Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":7.323,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"ffe8586a-b5bd-40a3-a92e-eff230a6822b","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":82,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Great day out","Text":"Great day out.

The staff were all really friendly and knowledgeable - especially the volunteers who seemed to be stationed at various enclosures around the zoo.   My son also enjoyed the Dinosaur area.  We had a picnic at the area near the Dinosaurs and also went in the Penguin Cafe for coffee and cake, which was lovely.  We loved our day and would definitely recommend the zoo."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.864914Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:33:05.496451Z","inner_id":84,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":85,"annotations":[{"id":85,"completed_by":1,"result":[],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T13:33:17.510700Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:33:17.510712Z","draft_created_at":null,"lead_time":10.269,"prediction":{},"result_count":0,"unique_id":"42c8df7a-eef1-4b17-ab0c-ed394aafa6fb","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":85,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Lovely day out","Text":"This is our second visit to the zoo and enjoyed it as much as the first time, 7 years ago.

There was plenty of parking, and The Holiday Inn Hotel right next door to the zoo is a new addition to my previous visit, very convenient if visiting the zoo. I do disagree with the car park charge however, on top of already very expensive admission. The toilets in the car park leave a lot to be desired however, only two and they were not very clean sadly. It was great to see such a variety of animals in the zoo, however there was a lot of climbing of steep hills. I can imagine elderly and disabled people struggling with this aspect, as well as having to push prams and pushchairs uphill. There were plenty of family picnic areas. I ate at The Gannet Restaurant with my family, however my mother and I are gluten-free, and we could only have soup. The zoo is incredibly limited in terms of food for gluten-free people so I suggest that you take your own as the restaurant certainly was not cheap. The chips were advertised as 'chip shop' however they certainly did not taste like it, completely dried out.  I love photography and there were some great opportunities. A new addition to my last visit is a collection of dinosaurs with sound effects which children seemed to really enjoy."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.864954Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:33:29.288825Z","inner_id":86,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":87,"annotations":[{"id":87,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":699,"end":704,"text":"tiger","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"V_FFMn-5K4","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":721,"end":730,"text":"red panda","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"UFk3akFqVu","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"},{"value":{"start":735,"end":741,"text":"monkey","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"kNVhh2qGXq","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T13:34:05.120384Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:34:05.120393Z","draft_created_at":"2025-07-01T13:33:46.920388Z","lead_time":34.922,"prediction":{},"result_count":3,"unique_id":"0df5ca13-ea5a-4928-a8cf-d390bb3bd414","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":87,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Not as good as people make out!","Text":"Hi all, visited Edinburgh zoo on our trip to Scotland. I absolutely love zoos and aquariums, i have done since i was little and i had high hopes. I’ve visited so many zoos and wildlife parks over the years and Edinburgh zoo is apparently supposed to be one of the best in the UK. How wrong that is. Has nothing on Chester Zoo and other places i’ve been to. I think any normal person would go to a zoo to see the actual animals rather than an array of shrubbery and trees upon trees. I am all for a very well looked after environment which the animals feel as though they’re in what seems like their natural habitat and feel safe and happy, i’m a lover of animals. Although the amount of cr*p in the tiger enclosures, the red panda and monkey enclosures is abit much. So much so that the animals can’t even be seen, i was so disappointed :( Again i’d like to reiterate that the treatment of the animals there was beautiful, and i am ALWAYS for a very safe happy and nourishing environment.Next thing is the toilets… the floors were covered in urine and absolutely stunk. There were young children in there holding their noses, parents were ushering them to come out due to the smell.The last and most important thing to warn people about is the terrain… the whole zoo is on a huge hill, for me, it was okay, but my older grandparents who wanted to see all the animals were completely unable to due to the steep hills, this isn’t an exaggeration. If anyone has any mobility or walking issues, please be aware of this, as this may limit the amount of animals you see and hinder your experience."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.864976Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:34:05.130910Z","inner_id":87,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]},{"id":88,"annotations":[{"id":88,"completed_by":1,"result":[{"value":{"start":615,"end":621,"text":"zebras","labels":["ANIMAL"]},"id":"9KOHMq9W6s","from_name":"label","to_name":"text","type":"labels","origin":"manual"}],"was_cancelled":false,"ground_truth":false,"created_at":"2025-07-01T13:34:28.585728Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:34:28.585823Z","draft_created_at":"2025-07-01T13:34:19.492639Z","lead_time":22.435,"prediction":{},"result_count":1,"unique_id":"537061b6-a860-4118-befd-d23bcfb60c18","import_id":null,"last_action":null,"bulk_created":false,"task":88,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"parent_prediction":null,"parent_annotation":null,"last_created_by":null}],"file_upload":"689151b9-edinburgh-zoo-reviews-300.csv","drafts":[],"predictions":[],"data":{"Review Title":"Unforgettable!","Text":"We've been looking forward to going to the zoo so much and the experience matched our expectations or possibly surpassed them.

We loved every bit of it.

The entry fee is very reasonable, as is the parking of which there is loads, just make sure you go early!The Red Pandas and penguins were my highlights. Most of the enclosures let you see from multiple angles so there's no annoying arriving at an enclosure to see it looking empty. Loads of talks by the keepers and other helpers around the zoo which is really nice to see and really informative.The penguin enclosure is fantastic and you get to see them from every angle. They have a wide range from rock hoppers to emperor penguins!Be warned there are some steep climbs to the top to see some of the animals but there are mobility scooters for hire and transport up to higher parts if needed. Sun cream and water is essential as there is very little shade."},"meta":{},"created_at":"2025-07-01T11:15:01.865332Z","updated_at":"2025-07-01T13:38:42.437640Z","inner_id":100,"total_annotations":1,"cancelled_annotations":0,"total_predictions":0,"comment_count":0,"unresolved_comment_count":0,"last_comment_updated_at":null,"project":1,"updated_by":1,"comment_authors":[]}]
