       "0  Had an amazing time here with my little girl and her gran on a sunny day in June.Variety of animals the zoo has is incredible, plenty of places to eat and drink, great selection of play parks for kids, and the staff do an amazing job of keeping the entire zoo immaculate.We all had a magical day and would highly recommend it for a day out with the family.It's a little bit hilly (especially on way up to see lions and tigers) but well worth the climb uphill to see such beautiful animals.The animal talks were highly engaging and would also highly recommend attending these when visiting.Keep up the brilliant work RZSS.   \n",

From arrival we were made very welcome. Staff took time out to talk to us and tell us about the animals. We loved the large enclosures that the animals had to roam in and had great views of many during the day. Thank you everyone for a great day!   \n",

The zoo was clean and tidy and the group loved it with the penguins being a firm favourite.  We even took advantage of the lunch voucher system and the visit triggered some additional workshops following the visit.   \n",

Just wish we'd had longer, but I'm sure we will return!   \n",
